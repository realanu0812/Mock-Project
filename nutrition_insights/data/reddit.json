If I was to have a very large meal with 70+ grams of protein from a source thats harder to digest like meat. Would eating fruits with proteases enzymes like pineapple, kiwi, and muscadine grapes help utilize and absorb more of the protein during the digestion process?"

Now my question is whether it is safe to eat a can of tuna everyday? Or two? It would be great to hit my protein in 10 minutes worth of tuna cans"

(Because the building calories aren’t currently being used for energy but are stored)\n\nHere’s the scenario: You have a maintenance of 2000 calories, you ingest 800 calories of protein bringing your daily net total to -1200 instead of -2000. The amino acids in the protein will be used for various things that aren’t providing energy for the body. Just for the sake of the exercise let’s say 50% energy 50% building. That would mean 400 calories are stored as your body builds itself up, and aren’t being currently used as energy.\n\nNow here is my question: Am I right in thinking that your body needs to now find an “additional” 400 calories to fuel itself? I agree calories in calories out in terms of total weight, but if you were trying to keep muscle mass but cut fat (if my way of thinking is even true) wouldn’t it be important to look at things in terms of what calories are being used to build and what calories are being used for energy instead of just total energy from all sources?\n\nSorry if this post comes across as naive but I just want to learn if I am missing some key information in how the body uses its energy from fat and protein\n\nThank you!"

It was eye-opening to discover that factors like digestive health, food combinations, stress levels, and even medical history can greatly influence how the body processes and utilizes nutrients.\n\nOne concrete example I experienced was with protein intake. After making a few diet adjustments recommended by them, my digestion and muscle recovery improved noticeably, even though the total amount of protein stayed the same. The difference came from how I combined the foods and the timing of when I consumed them.\n\nI think it's worth paying more attention not just to what we eat, but also to how and how well the body uses it."

So im asking if its the protein already in your system (day before), or the protein that's starting digestion (day of), or the protein while sore and in recovery (day after), that has the largest effect on muscle growth? \n\nAgain, im asking solely to understand how protein actually affects muscle growth, not looking to only eat protein once every 3 days or looking for diet advice, thanks!"

But then a bag of Goya dried red lentils is 160 calories, 11g protein, 5g fiber. Lower fiber and 1g of protein per every ~14 calories. \n\nNot just lentils either. I have Iberia red kidney beans, which are 70 calories, 9g protein, 14g fiber per serving (1g protein per 8 calories). Goya's label for the same beans says 140 calories, 9g protein, 6g fiber (1g protein per 16 calories). Way less protein and fiber than Iberia. \n\nAnd this is across so many other brands too, different for every brand, different for canned vs. dried. What's the deal??\n\nI'd like to point out that I know the serving sizes vary across each product, but that doesn't explain why the calorie to protein and calorie to fiber ratio is so different."

The product adds 3g of leucine and this supposedly improve the amino acid profile of SPI. The logic seems to add up but I am curious if this makes a good source compare to whey protein WPC/WPI.\n\n2. Whether in food industry it is acceptable to not call this as \"amino spiking\" that is synonymous with scamming protein amount per serving due to higher nitrogen content. \n\nIf the product is transparent of its purpose but uses protein content per serving without deducting the added leucine; is it considered amino spiking?

I regularly go to the gym and lift weights/kettle bell workouts. In the past I’ve eaten out a lot and would eat a lot of high carb meals, my metabolism is pretty fast so I’ve never gained too much weight. \n\nI’ve gotten a lot leaner on keto and have felt great. I’ve been invited to a meal tonight of fried calamari and French fries. \n\nThis motivated me to do some more research on keto and I’m reading that it can be really bad to have cheat meals. I don’t NEED to do keto since I’m generally pretty healthy, but I do like the benefits. As well as the creative meals, like pork grind and cream cheese/shredded cheese crust pizza.  \n\nMy question is - is it harmful to eat Keto meals while also consuming regular meals every now and then? Like protein pasta one night, then a keto pizza the next?"

Recently, they switched the packaging on the chocolate flavor (brown -> purple). I picked up a case last week and it tastes completely different. It doesn’t taste like chocolate at all, frankly. It tastes like plain milk, even after shaking it vigorously. \n\nI filed a product complaint with Premier Protein today and I’m waiting to hear back. I’m not optimistic that my case was a one-off manufacturing error, but I’m interested to hear what they say. In the end, if they say nothing is wrong with it, then I’ll be switching to a different brand. \n\nHas anyone else experienced a total change to the chocolate flavor after the packaging switched?"

I am very busy and just don't feel like cooking and don't want to live off of ultra processed protein bars snacks protein drinks etc as much as I do. I'm also spending a lot eating out and would like to cut that down\n\nI was looking at Nutrition Solutions but then realized that their smallest program is like $200+ a WEEK and the smallest program they have is like 12 meals a week which is a ton. I am looking for something smaller, like maybe 3-4 meals dispersed throughout the week and a lower cost in my budget.\n\nI'm hoping to just pop something in the microwave for a few minutes and be ready to go.\n\nAre there any good quality frozen dinners that you guys have regularly that are decent quality and value? \n\nAny ideas would be appreciated 👍"
