The non-medicinal ingredients includes stevia, sucralose and then natural and artificial flavors including maltodextrin, citric acid and sodium citrate. \n\nApparently, maltodextrin can Spike blood sugar and also irritate the gut, potentially impacting permeability. Some reports seems to suggest you should avoid it. However I've also read that the amount you would find in a couple of scoops of protein powder is negligible.\n\nDoes anyone have any insight?"

(Because the building calories aren’t currently being used for energy but are stored)\n\nHere’s the scenario: You have a maintenance of 2000 calories, you ingest 800 calories of protein bringing your daily net total to -1200 instead of -2000. The amino acids in the protein will be used for various things that aren’t providing energy for the body. Just for the sake of the exercise let’s say 50% energy 50% building. That would mean 400 calories are stored as your body builds itself up, and aren’t being currently used as energy.\n\nNow here is my question: Am I right in thinking that your body needs to now find an “additional” 400 calories to fuel itself? I agree calories in calories out in terms of total weight, but if you were trying to keep muscle mass but cut fat (if my way of thinking is even true) wouldn’t it be important to look at things in terms of what calories are being used to build and what calories are being used for energy instead of just total energy from all sources?\n\nSorry if this post comes across as naive but I just want to learn if I am missing some key information in how the body uses its energy from fat and protein\n\nThank you!"

Rye flour contains high levels of phytase that will be activated during the soaking process. ... Even without the rye flour, overnight soaking of oats and other low-phytase grains greatly improves digestibility but won’t eliminate too much phytic acid. ... You can keep whole rye grains and grind a small amount in a mini grinder for adding to these grains during the soaking process.\" (https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/vegetarianism-and-plant-foods/living-with-phytic-acid)\n\nIs it safe to consume raw cracked rye if it's been soaked for, say, 12-15 hours.

Two people can eat exactly the same foods yet have completely different outcomes in terms of energy, digestion, or body composition.\n\nI started working with JM Nutrition, a group of registered nutritionists here in Canada, to understand why, in my case, certain meal plans didn't produce the same results I saw in others. It was eye-opening to discover that factors like digestive health, food combinations, stress levels, and even medical history can greatly influence how the body processes and utilizes nutrients.\n\nOne concrete example I experienced was with protein intake. After making a few diet adjustments recommended by them, my digestion and muscle recovery improved noticeably, even though the total amount of protein stayed the same. The difference came from how I combined the foods and the timing of when I consumed them.\n\nI think it's worth paying more attention not just to what we eat, but also to how and how well the body uses it."

However questions arise on:\n\n1. How beneficial is this in improving SPI protein quality for muscle synthesis. The product adds 3g of leucine and this supposedly improve the amino acid profile of SPI. The logic seems to add up but I am curious if this makes a good source compare to whey protein WPC/WPI.\n\n2. Whether in food industry it is acceptable to not call this as \"amino spiking\" that is synonymous with scamming protein amount per serving due to higher nitrogen content. \n\nIf the product is transparent of its purpose but uses protein content per serving without deducting the added leucine; is it considered amino spiking? Is all \"amino spiking\" bad? Should the company revise their labels, marketing and change the protein content advertised? \n\nI am more inclined to say it's okay but perhaps people from the nutrition field can describe it better or have specific opinions.\n\nThis is not a post seeking professional medical advice."

Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy (microFTIR) is a valuable, non-destructive method for analysing the main biological macromolecules at the microscopic level. Therefore, it may offer insight into the investigation of both primary and secondary myopathies. In our work we use microFTIR to identify unique spectral markers associated with disease progression. For this purpose, muscle tissues from patients diagnosed with dystrophy and myopathy, as well as control tissues, were subjected to probing. The results reveal significant differences in the distribution of lipid, protein, and nucleic acid absorption bands among the sample groups, particularly in regions associated with muscle fibre and connective tissue structure.

    "text": "Aspartic acid (Asp) and glutamic acid (Glu), as critical neurotransmitters, exhibit concentration abnormalities closely associated with epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurological disorders. However, current detection methods face limitations in selectivity, sensitivity, and practicality. In this study, we developed a series of novel D-π-A structured fluorescent probes (PM-1, PM-2, PM-3, and PM-4), Among which PM-4 demonstrates weak monomer emission (540 nm) in aqueous solution. The pyridine side chain of PM-4 forms hydrogen bonds with the dual carboxylate groups of Asp/Glu, triggering the formation of emissive excimers. This process generates a new, enhanced red-shifted emission peak at 630 nm, enabling specific detection. The detection limits reached 1.26 μM (Asp) and 1.29 μM (Glu), with high selectivity. The formation mechanism of the probe-analyte complex was confirmed by NMR titration experiments. PM-4 successfully monitored diurnal fluctuations of Asp/Glu in saliva samples from healthy volunteers and concentration variations after smoking, revealing a correlation with emotional states (e.g., peak concentrations observed 10 min after smoking). The developed PM-4 probe integrates high sensitivity, selectivity, providing a powerful analytical tool for neurometabolic studies and disease biomarker detection. Its demonstrated performance highlights promising potential for both fundamental research and diagnostic product development."

In this study, we present a comprehensive aptamer-involved surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (aptamer-SERS)-based protocol specifically designed for large-scale clinical screening of the circulating protein MUC1 overexpressed in the majority of breast cancer cases. Central to our approach was a \"sandwich\" assay, where MUC1 was anchored between aptamer-functionalized bimetallic core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) and magnetic nanobeads. The biosensor was applied to monitor MUC1 in serum samples through SERS signals from the reporter molecule 4-ATP, exhibiting a strong linear correlation across a wide dynamic range and the lower the limit of detection (LOD) of 2.96 fg/mL. To support clinical decision-making, the protocol was integrated with a machine learning (ML)model for the classification of SERS signal patterns, demonstrating performance metrics of 96% accuracy and 93.7% specificity when applied to diverse serum samples. This integration enabled robust, non-invasive preclinical screening that informs therapeutic regulation and patient monitoring long before clinical symptoms present. By establishing a scalable framework for continuous monitoring of MUC1 levels across large populations, our study offered a forward-thinking tool, namely, dual-aptamer-SERS biosensor, that may optimize individualized treatment planning and improve overall clinical management strategies."

In this study, a glucose transporter protein 1-targeted nanodrug (RCPM) was developed by coordinating rutin with polymetallic ions, including Fe, V, and Pt. RCPM selectively targeted CDDP-resistant A549 (A549R) cells, efficiently accumulating within tumors. Exhibiting exceptional photothermal (PT) properties, RCPM facilitated PT-induced tumor ablation. Within the tumor microenvironment, RCPM underwent degradation, releasing high concentrations of V, Fe, and CDDP. The liberated V and Fe ions catalyzed the Fenton reaction, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inducing ferroptosis. Simultaneously, these metal ions synergistically suppressed the expression of excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1), glutathione (GSH), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), effectively disrupting DNA repair pathways, preventing CDDP inactivation, and enhancing its cytotoxicity against A549R tumors. Furthermore, RCPM demonstrated complete and rapid renal clearance, ensuring excellent biosafety and strong clinical translational potential. In vivo studies revealed that a single administration of RCPM, combined with PT therapy, significantly inhibited NSCLC progression. These findings highlight RCPM as a promising nanodrug for overcoming CDDP resistance and enhancing NSCLC treatment efficacy."

We reviewed VAERS reports on RSV vaccines, using the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) to identify safety signals. Our analysis incorporated severity, time-to-onset, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses to enhance key findings. After analyzing 5,147 RSVPreF3, 2,734 RSVpreF, and 35 mRNA-1345 reports, 91, 103, and 8 positive PT signals were found, respectively. Among serious reports, both RSVPreF3 and RSVpreF were associated with 9 important medical events (IMEs), including immune thrombocytopenia, which was also classified as a designated medical event (DME). Three pregnancy-related IME signals-hemorrhage in pregnancy, fetal death, and fetal hypokinesia - were reported for RSVpreF. Descriptive analysis of time-to-onset complemented the overall safety profiling, and sensitivity analysis offered further support for the observed disproportional reporting trends in certain adverse events (AEs).

To address this gap, a user-friendly, dynamic online nomogram was developed to predict the incidence of positive urine cultures in patients with urolithiasis.\n\nMETHODS: A retrospective study was conducted with 3,641 patients with urinary stones at the Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University. The cohort was split into training and validation sets. Key variables were identified using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, while Random Forest and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods were applied to assess their importance. Online nomograms were developed and evaluated for performance through metrics such as area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA), probability density function (PDF), and clinical utility curve (CUC).\n\nRESULTS: Multivariate logistic analysis identified four significant predictors-bacteria (BACT), C-reactive protein (CRP), nitrite, and leukocyte esterase (LEU)-which were integrated into the nomogram. The AUC values for the overall, training, and validation sets were 90.53, 91.22, and 89.06%, respectively. Calibration curves confirmed the nomogram's accuracy, and DCA demonstrated its superior performance over individual metrics. The PDF/CUC method revealed a threshold of 0.168, which effectively distinguished 88.54% of negatives from 78.70% of positives.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This dynamic online nomogram accurately predicts positive urine cultures in patients with urolithiasis, helping clinicians identify high-risk individuals , optimize antibiotic use, and improve patient outcomes.

Differentially expressed FRGs linked to AKI were identified through analytical methods, followed by an examination of their biological functions. Diagnostic biomarkers were then selected using LASSO, RFE, and RF algorithms. Additionally, small pharmacological molecules associated with DE-FRGs were identified to explore the connection between DE-FRGs and AKI. qRT-PCR analysis revealed FAR1 expression in AKI, while Western blotting and IHC confirmed corresponding FAR1 protein changes in kidney tissues. TUNEL staining confirmed cell death in AKI.

This review systematically classifies PNP-DDSs derived from natural proteins (albumin, gelatin, silk fibroin, and plant-derived proteins) and discusses their design principles along with strategies for intestinal targeting, including particle size and surface charge modulation, stimuli-responsive release (triggered by pH, reactive oxygen species, or enzymes), and active targeting. It highlights recent preclinical advances with oral PNP-DDSs delivering curcumin, resveratrol, 5-aminosalicylic acid, quercetin, and other anti-inflammatory agents, which demonstrate the therapeutic potential of these nanoplatforms in IBD models. Despite promising preclinical outcomes, clinical translation of PNP-DDSs remains challenging due to patient heterogeneity, manufacturing scale-up difficulties, and safety concerns. Future progress will require interdisciplinary innovation and optimization of multi‑stimuli-responsive designs for precise and safe clinical application of PNP-DDSs in IBD management."

The aim of this study is to investigate the economic impact associated with SI on healthcare costs and resource utilization among individuals with concomitant atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Utilizing Danish national health registers, the study identifies patients with incident ASCVD and CKD from 2012 to 2022 based on diagnosis codes and laboratory results. SI is defined as CRP from 2 mg/L to 20 mg/L. The increased cost and use of healthcare services associated with SI is identified by comparing individuals with SI with individuals without SI. Statistical adjustments are made for age, sex, and comorbidities to control for confounding factors.\n\nRESULTS: Among patients with ASCVD and CKD, the presence of SI was significantly associated with higher healthcare interactions, with an average increase of 6.7 outpatient and 7.0 more inpatient contacts over the study period compared to those without SI. Furthermore, SI is associated with a 1.4-fold increase in healthcare expenditure, resulting in an excess cost of EUR 14,370 per patient over the first 3 years of the follow-up period.\n\nLIMITATIONS: The lack of a definitive onset date for SI complicates the analysis, as it is based on CRP tests conducted within 2 years of ASCVD and CKD diagnoses, potentially excluding individuals with prolonged SI prior to testing.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: SI is associated with higher healthcare resource utilization and costs among patients with ASCVD and CKD."

    "text": "In regenerative medicine, the demand for biomaterials with customizable properties to address diverse clinical challenges is steadily increasing. Collagen-based scaffolds offer significant promise for tissue engineering applications. This study presents a novel 5-layer collagen laminate engineered to facilitate both infection control and bone and tissue regeneration in open bone fractures. The laminate employs a layering strategy with rose bengal and green light-induced crosslinking to facilitate assembly while enabling the controlled release of three bioactive molecules, vancomycin, Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1α). Mechanical properties were evaluated using a high-capacity load cell, revealing that multi-layer configurations exhibited reduced stiffness and tensile strength compared to single-layer laminates. Notably, incubation with Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts (NHDF) holds the potential to enhance interlayer cohesion and improve the mechanical integrity of 5-layer laminates. Furthermore, the composition of collagen within the laminate played a critical role in determining both mechanical behavior and release kinetics. Singular sheets of Endoform™ Natural (E) collagen displayed rapid release, while Geistlich Bio-Gide® (G) collagen sheets provided sustained release, reflecting their distinct structural characteristics. These findings underscore the potential of multi-layer collagen laminates as a versatile platform for tailored therapeutic applications in regenerative medicine."

This study applies transcriptome data to investigate shared molecular mechanisms underlying AF and OSA comorbidity and develops a robust diagnostic model to evaluate OSA risk in AF patients.\n\nMETHODS: Transcriptomic datasets for AF (GSE79768) and OSA (GSE135917) were retrieved from the the Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with OSA and AF comorbidity were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using Cytoscape, and hub genes were identified with the CytoHubba plug-in. A diagnostic model was then built based on these hub genes, and its performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in both the test and validation datasets. Immune cell infiltration analysis was conducted using CIBERSORT.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 1,462 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified for the comorbidity of AF and OSA. Five hub genes were selected: IFNG, IL4, IL15, CD19, and FASLG. Immunoassay infiltration analysis revealed elevated levels of activated macrophages in both OSA and AF samples. The diagnostic model we developed demonstrated excellent predictive performance in the validation set.\n\nCONCLUSION: We identified five hub genes common to both OSA and AF: IFNG, IL4, IL15, CD19, and FASLG. Moreover, a diagnostic model based on these five hub genes can predict the risk of OSA in patients with AF."

Evidence shows that TTR contributes to neuroprotection, cognition, glucose regulation, pregnancy, muscle development, and bone mineralization. In several disease states, including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, cerebrovascular disease, and osteoporosis, higher TTR levels may be protective. Numerous studies have shown that low levels of TTR are associated with increased mortality overall and in relation to cardiovascular disease and several malignancies.\n\nPURPOSE: There is a growing portfolio of approved and investigational transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) treatments that differ in their mechanisms and effects on circulating TTR. When selecting an ATTR therapy, clinicians must decide whether to stabilize and preserve TTR and its functions or knockdown and drastically reduce TTR. This review summarizes the vital physiologic roles of TTR in health and disease. We consider the potential effects on normal biologic pathways that may occur while therapeutically suppressing TTR and discuss clinical decisions concerning ATTR therapies in the context of the summarized literature.\n\nDISCUSSION: TTR is essential for a broad range of physiologic processes and may confer clinically protective effects in neurologic and other organ systems. While a link between low TTR and severe disease and mortality is well established, it remains unclear whether long-term TTR suppression\n\nCONCLUSION: TTR serves vital physiologic roles across organ systems. Given its clinically protective properties, continued investigation into the potential long-term impact of TTR suppression"

Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed on DEMAGs. The PPI protein interaction network and machine learning were applied to identify Hub genes, which were also validated by GSE46474, an external validation set. We constructed a rat model of acute rejection of kidney transplantation and sequenced the transcriptome of the serum, and using the sequencing results, we analyzed the expression levels of the Hub gene. Then, a correlation analysis was carried out based on the Hub genes and different immune cell infiltration levels. Finally, GRNdb, miRDB, and GeneCards databases were applied to study the transcription factors, miRNAs, and regulatory drugs of Hub genes, respectively.\n\nRESULTS: The results of the Cibersort analysis revealed that M2-type macrophages were expressed higher in the Normal group. In addition, the results of the correlation analysis suggested that the expressions of Hub genes were negatively correlated with M1-type macrophages and positively correlated with M2-type macrophages.\n\nCONCLUSION: A diagnostic model of the macrophage-associated acute renal transplant rejection in peripheral blood was constructed based on CCR2 and TLR3, which can accurately diagnose the biological alterations of acute kidney transplant rejection.

In this study, we modelled infection with a highly pathogenic recombinant human A/Texas/37/2024 H5N1 (rHPh-TX H5N1) strain using human airway organoids (HAO) to investigate viral replication, innate immune response, infection-induced fibrogenesis, and potential therapeutic interventions. rHPh-TX H5N1 replicated efficiently in HAO, eliciting a robust interferon (IFN) response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Prolonged infection led to the accumulation of fibroblast-like cells surrounding infected regions, marked by increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), indicative of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. Compared to organoids infected with the pandemic A/California/04/09 H1N1 (pH1N1) strain, rHPh-TX H5N1 induced significantly higher expression of fibrosis-associated markers, including fibronectin (FN), collagen 1A (COL1A), collagen 3A (COL3A), metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2, and MMP9). Notably, the inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinases (ROCK) signalling reduced fibrogenesis, with ROCK1 inhibition being more effective than ROCK2 inhibition. These findings highlight the potential of targeting ROCK signalling to mitigate H5N1-induced lung fibrosis, informing therapeutic strategies for severe influenza infections."

Participants were classified into two groups based on the timing of delivery: PE-delivery (delivery within 1 week of sample collection) and PE-non-delivery (no delivery within 1 week). Urine and serum samples were collected at the time of PE diagnosis, and cases were classified based on the presence of maternal or fetal complications.\n\nRESULTS: In total, 53 singleton pregnancies were analyzed and classified into the PE-delivery (n = 32) and PE-non-delivery groups (n = 21). No significant differences in L-FABP levels were observed between severe and non-severe PE cases. However, L-FABP levels were significantly higher in cases of severe PE due to maternal factors. In the PE-delivery group, urine and serum L-FABP levels were significantly elevated in cases requiring delivery within 1 week due to maternal indications compared to the PE-non-delivery group, whereas no such differences were found in cases with fetal indications. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed strong predictive performance of L-FABP levels for delivery within 1 week due to maternal deterioration, with areas under the curve of 0.892 (urine, cutoff: 12.3 μg/gCr) and 0.795 (serum, cutoff: 1.64 ng/mL).\n\nCONCLUSION: Maternal urine and serum L-FABP levels are closely associated with PE severity due to maternal complications and may serve as reliable biomarkers for imminent maternal deterioration."

    "text": "The human gut microbiome impacts host health through metabolite production, notably short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived from digestion-resistant carbohydrates (DRCs). While DRC supplementation offers a means to modulate the microbiome therapeutically, its effectiveness is often limited by the microbial community's complexity and individual variability in microbiome functionality. We utilized genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) from the AGORA collection to provide a system-level overview of the metabolic capabilities of human gut microbes in terms of carbohydrate trophic networks and propose improved therapeutic interventions, based on microbial community design. Our study inferred the capability of AGORA strains to consume carbohydrates of varying structural complexities - including DRCs - and to produce metabolites amenable to cross-feeding, such as SCFAs. The resulting functional database indicated that DRC-degrading abilities are rare among gut microbes, suggesting that the presence or absence of specific taxa can determine the success of DRC-based interventions. Additionally, we found that metabolite production profiles exceed family-level variation, highlighting the limitations in predicting intervention outcomes based on gut microbial composition assessed at higher taxonomic levels. In response to these findings, we integrate reverse ecology principles, network analysis and GEM community modeling to guide the design of minimal yet resilient microbial communities to better guarantee intervention response (purpose-based communities). As a proof of principle, we predicted a purpose-based community designed to enhance butyrate production when used in conjunction with DRC supplementation that displays resilience under nutritional stress, such as amino acid restriction. We further seeded the identified purpose-based community into modeled human microbiomes previously demonstrated to accurately predict SCFA production profiles. The analysis confirmed that such intervention significantly promotes butyrate production across samples, with those that presented a comparatively lower butyrate production pre-intervention displaying the largest increase in butyrate production after seeding. Our work highlights the potential of combining GEMs with community design to infer effective microbiome interventions, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes."

Measure the interventricular septum (IVS) thickness through cardiac ultrasound and evaluate the level of ANGPTL7 in umbilical cord blood using the ELISA method.\n\nRESULTS: The incidence of myocardial hypertrophy in the GDM group was 19.6%, significantly higher than 0% in the control group, and increased to 27.3% in neonates of mothers with GDM and poor glycaemic control. ANGPTL7 levels in the GDM group were significantly elevated compared to the control group (1.87 vs. 1.11 ng/mL). Furthermore, these levels were positively correlated with IVS thickness. In the poorly-controlled GDM subgroup (GDM-A), neonates had significantly higher ANGPTL7 levels and IVS/LVPW ratio (1.19 vs. 1.03), indicating more severe myocardial abnormalities.\n\nCONCLUSION: ANGPTL7 may contribute to myocardial hypertrophy in GDM neonates by promoting insulin resistance.

Although both are linked to cardiovascular and metabolic health, the relationship between AIP and α-Klotho, particularly regarding sex differences, remains unclear.\n\nMETHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a community-based cohort drawn from five consecutive cycles of the NHANES (January 2007 - December 2016). A total of 4,897 participants aged 40 to 79 years were included. Weighted multivariate linear regression models assessed the association between AIP and serum α-Klotho (SαKl) levels, adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. Sex-stratified analyses explored potential effect modification.\n\nRESULTS: Mean ± SE SαKl level was 869.9 ± 8.6 pg/mL in females and 826.6 ± 10.2 pg/mL in males; mean ± SE AIP values were -0.09 ± 0.01 and 0.05 ± 0.01, respectively.

Prospective studies are warranted to confirm causality and to determine whether improving lipid profiles can preserve SαKl and related health outcomes."

    "text": "Adynamic bone disorder, common in chronic kidney disease (CKD), results from reduced bone turnover, often due to medications such as calcimimetics or high-dose vitamin D analogs that induce low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Numerous factors contributing to PTH hyporesponsiveness, which also induces low bone turnover, include deficient PTH, uremic toxins like indoxyl sulfate, malnutrition, inflammation, and diabetes. Diagnosis typically involves bone biopsy, although it is inconvenient. Biomarkers like bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and intact PTH (iPTH) show promise in distinguishing between low and high bone turnover. Meta-analysis suggests that levels of iPTH below 150 pg/mL or BALP levels below 20 μg/l indicate low bone turnover. Treatments aim to improve bone density without hindering repair, with osteo-anabolic medications being favored for low PTH levels and anti-resorptive agents being cautioned. Romosozumab, while effective, has safety concerns that limit its use. Uremic toxins are reduced by AST-120 treatment, which alleviates PTH hypo-responsiveness and bone toxicity. Adjunctive measures include addressing vitamin D deficiency, and diabetes, and utilizing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory therapies. Overall, BALP and iPTH appear as potential promising biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring adynamic bone disorder in CKD, effectively guiding therapeutic interventions."

Thus, the present work aimed to evaluate the effects of combined training (CT) on the QoL of individuals with overweight-related type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to correlate (baseline values and CT-induced delta percentage changes (Δ%)) QoL variables with hormonal, inflammatory, and pro-thermogenic/anti-inflammatory components.\n\nMETHODS: Middle-aged individuals of both sexes and with overweight-related T2DM were assigned to either the control group (CONT group) or the combined training group (CTG). The CT consisted of strength training followed by aerobic training three times/week for 16 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included QoL perception, clinical variables, serum biochemical markers, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity.\n\nRESULTS: The CTG showed improvement in the perception of general QoL (20.0%) and in the physical (12.7%) and social (10.1%) domains. Significant positive correlations were observed between QoL variables with interleukin- 4 (IL-4), IL-10, IL-13, IL-33, Fibroblast growth factor- 21 (FGF-21), bone morphogenetic protein- 4 (BMP4), irisin, and BAT activity, alongside negative correlations with IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, c reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and incretin hormones at baseline and/or in the Δ% changes induced by training.\n\nCONCLUSION: CT improves the perception of general QoL and the physical and social domains of individuals with overweight-related T2DM. Baseline and in the Δ% of CT change, QoL components are related with several clinical, hormonal, inflammatory, and pro-thermogenic/anti-inflammatory markers, besides BAT increased activity."

However, it remains unclear whether Ses exerts a protective effect against APAP-induced kidney injury.\n\nMETHODS: In vivo, C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with Ses and injected intraperitoneally with APAP. In vitro, human kidney proximal tubule cells 2 were pretreated with Ses, and then models of kidney injury induced by APAP were established. Kidney damage was evaluated by morphological, inflammation, oxidative stress and protein analyzes.\n\nRESULTS: Ses significantly improved APAP-induced nephrotoxicity in vitro and in vivo models. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in ferroptosis and apoptosis signaling pathways, identifying heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) as a core protein. In the Ses-treated group, ferroptosis and apoptosis were significantly inhibited, while HMOX1 was effectively restored. In cell experiments, both the HMOX1 agonist hemin and Ses attenuated ferroptosis and apoptosis. HMOX1 inhibitor Zinc Protoporphyrin significantly eliminated the protective effect of Ses.\n\nCONCLUSION: Ses alleviates APAP-induced renal injury by mediating the inhibition of ferroptosis and apoptosis via HMOX1. This study provides a new strategy for the prevention and treatment of drug-induced renal injury."

    "text": "Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are often designed to not only bind targets via their antigen-binding domains (Fabs) but to also engage with cell surface receptors, FcγRs and FcRn, through their Fc regions, which may result in a variety of functional outcomes, including antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and alteration of circulating half-lives. Engineering the Fc regions to achieve desirable pharmacology and pharmacokinetics is a widely adopted strategy in drug development. Fc regions can be modified through amino acid substitutions and glycoengineering, resulting in enhanced or reduced effector functions, preferential binding to FcR subtypes, or pH-dependent binding to FcRns. These alterations in binding and effector activities of mAbs may potentially also be accompanied by undesirable effects or safety concerns. Critical assessment of pharmacology and safety in the nonclinical setting is essential before exposing humans to the engineered mAb. For Fc-modified mAbs, the choice of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical pharmacology and safety models need to account for species differences in FcR expression and function, potentially divergent effects of Fc modifications in humans versus nonclinical species, impact of target and cognate ligand expression patterns, and potential impact of emergent anti-drug antibodies directed against the mAb. Using a variety of industry case studies, we highlight key aspects of nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology testing strategies, factors that influence choice of nonclinical models, translatability of findings, input from health authorities and suggest best practice approaches for nonclinical testing of Fc modified mAbs."

Due to this structural complexity, bsAbs exhibit greater heterogeneity as compared to monospecific antibodies and may require nonstandard purification strategies to remove undesired product-related impurities. However, the implementation of unique manufacturing processes may result in the observation of new impurities. When new impurities are identified, comprehensive characterization of these species is needed to understand the potential impact to the safety and efficacy of the product. In this study, the assessment of a unique purification mode, protein L affinity chromatography, for purification of a bsAb resulted in high levels of free light chain (LC) in the final product. It was discovered that the free LC formed oligomers of various sizes upon accelerated stress in a concentration-, time-, and temperature-dependent manner. This is the first time free LC oligomer has been reported as a product-related impurity. Characterization of the free LC and free LC oligomer species was performed using a variety of chromatographic, electrophoretic, and mass spectrometry tools to gain insight on the formation and behavior of these impurities in the product. These studies informed an impact assessment of the observed free LC and free LC oligomer species on safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and bioactivity."

This study aims to compare the performance of two widely used Ki-67 antibody clones, MIB1 and SP6, and to evaluate their impact on molecular subtyping in breast cancer. Sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy samples from 35 primary breast carcinoma cases were stained using MIB1 and SP6 antibodies. Histological tumor characteristics and receptor statuses were evaluated for each case. The Ki-67 proliferative index was assessed following the latest recommendations of the International Ki-67 in Breast Cancer Working Group. Statistical analysis included Pearson correlation, paired t-test, Welch's ANOVA, and McNemar's test. A strong correlation was observed between Ki-67 indices obtained using MIB1 and SP6 (r = 0.755, p < 0.001), with no statistically significant difference in mean values (p = 0.288). Ki-67 index correlated significantly with tumor grade for both antibodies. Among Luminal HER2-negative tumors, 17 % showed discordant molecular subtyping between MIB1 and SP6 using a 20 % cut-off. Similar discrepancies were observed at 14 % and 25 % cut-offs, suggesting that antibody choice may affect subtype classification. In conclusion, both MIB1 and SP6 provide reliable assessment of proliferative index in breast carcinoma, however, discrepancies in individual cases may impact molecular subtyping and subsequent clinical decision-making. Therefore, reporting the antibody clone used in Ki-67 evaluation may be advisable, pending further validation."

Bispecific antibodies (bsAb) that bind to transmembrane protein expressed at the BBB, such as the transferrin receptor (TfR), have shown enhanced brain exposure in rodents and non-human primate (NHP) due to receptor-mediated transcytosis. However, it remains unclear how preclinical findings translate to humans. Moreover, optimal TfR binding affinity remains a subject of debate. Model-informed drug discovery and development is a powerful approach that has been successfully used to support research and development. The goal of this analysis was to expand a published brain minimal physiologically based pharmacokinetic (mPBPK) model to investigate the optimal TfR binding affinity for maximal brain delivery in NHP and to facilitate prediction of the PK of anti-TfR bsAbs in humans from NHP data. Literature data for plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain exposure after administration of non-TfR mAbs and monovalent bsAbs with respect to TfR in NHP were used to develop the TfR mPBPK model. Clinical validation using human PK data from plasma and CSF for the monovalent anti-TfR bsAb trontinemab demonstrated good predictive performance without major model recalibration. The availability of the TfR mPBPK model is envisaged to provide better understanding of the relationship between TfR binding affinity, dose, and brain exposure, which would lead to more robust selection of lead candidates and efficacious dosing regimens."

Second, we further intergrated the single-cell analysis, machine learning, and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods to validate the role of the inflammatory protein in rejected transplanted kidneys.\n\nRESULTS: In MR analysis, the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method showed that N-acetylaspartyl glutamate (NAAG) levels reduced the risk of graft dysfunction (OR 0.648, 95% CI 0.522-0.805). Interleukin-2 receptor subunit beta (IL-2RB) mediated the association between NAAG and graft dysfunction with a mediation ratio of 11.35% (95% CI 1.85%-24.69%). In transplanted kidneys, IL-2RB is predominantly expressed elevated in T cells from rejection samples and is associated with decreased renal function. 10 hub genes were identified based on T cells with high and low expression of IL-2RB, of which NGboost reached AUC 0.77. The SHAP method obtained the gene with the greatest model contribution: the IL-2RB gene.\n\nCONCLUSION: NAAG plays a protective role in graft dysfunction, and part of the effect is mediated by inhibition of IL-2RB, which is verified as an important gene that functions in transplant kidney rejection. NAAG and IL-2RB may be novel molecular markers and therapeutic targets for graft dysfunction."

The datasets GSE226840, GSE237120, and GSE116626 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were employed to investigate the potential therapeutic targets of TLS in IgAN. The R was used to obtain the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of three datasets, and the Venny was used to intersect the above three parts of the DEGs to obtain the common DEGs. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed on obtained genes using Metascape. Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. The intersection of the above common differential genes and IgAN differential genes was obtained by Venny tool. The Nephroseq platform was used to screen core genes and explore their relationship with clinical features. Meanwhile, CIBERSORT was utilized to further delve into the correlation between core genes and immune cells. 92 TLS-related genes and 486 IgAN related genes were obtained, and 6 common genes were obtained after crossing the two genes. The intersection genes were verified by Nephroseq, and CDKN1A, CD83, DUSP6, and CD48 were identified as core genes. At the same time, there were differences in the composition of immune cells between the disease group and the control group when the immune infiltration analysis was performed. And by further analyzing the correlation between core genes and immune cells, the study found that the four genes were positively correlated with T cells, B cells, plasma cells, and other immune cells. By exploring the relationship between core genes and clinical features, CDKN1A and DUSP6 were negatively correlated with Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) and positively correlated with proteinuria in IgAN patients. CD48 was negatively correlated with GFR and positively correlated with Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN). The four genes highly associated with TLS and IgAN were screened using GEO database in study. And CDKN1A, CD83, DUSP6 and CD48 may provide potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of TLS in IgAN. At the same time, studies have found that T cells, B cells, and macrophages may be involved in the formation of TLS in IgAN."

However, this approach may compromise chirality-dependent therapeutic efficacy and potentially underestimate the significance of chirality in nanomedicine. Herein, supramolecular chiral nanoparticles, D/L-arginine (Arg)-meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl) porphine (TCPP), were constructed through the self-assembly of D/L-Arg and TCPP. Owing to the interaction between D/L-Arg and TCPP, chirality transfer from D/L-Arg to TCPP was observed, which resulted in the direct chiral induction of TCPP within supramolecular assemblies. Furthermore, driven by enantioselective interaction with proteins, D-Arg-TCPP demonstrated 1.5-fold greater cellular uptake efficiency than L-Arg-TCPP via caveolin-dependent endocytosis. Thus, the enantiomer-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating capacity-induced photodynamic anti-tumor performance, with D-Arg-TCPP exhibiting 1.9 times higher efficacy than L-Arg-TCPP, was verified. Our findings not only elucidate the mechanisms underlying chirality-dependent behavior of porphyrin-based supramolecular assemblies, but also pave a new avenue for optimizing chirality-mediated cancer therapy."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: High-risk gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are highly heterogeneous. This study aimed to developa nomogram for predicting recurrence in patients with high-risk GISTand to provide guidance for adjuvant therapy.\n\nMETHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from 971 patients with high-risk GIST who underwent genetic testingat 13 centers in China. A nomogram was constructed in the training cohort and validated in the validation cohort.\n\nRSEULTS: The training and validation cohorts included 696 and 275 patients, respectively. The nomogram incorporated blood plateletlevels, total protein, tumor location, tumor size, mitotic count, tumor rupture, Ki-67 index, and gene mutations. The C-index and AUC were 0.758 and 0.781 in the training cohort and 0.841 and 0.755, respectively, in the validation cohort. Calibration and DCA curves confirmed favorable discrimination, calibration accuracy, and clinical benefits. Using the nomogram, patients were categorized into a general high-risk groupand a very high-risk group. Among the general high-risk group, no significant difference in RFS was observed between patients who received adjuvant imatinib for 2.5 years or longer. Conversely, in the very high-risk group, patients receiving adjuvant imatinib for five or more years had markedly improved RFS.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on the largest nomogram-related multicenter study in high-risk GIST, the nomogram accurately predicted RFS in patients with high-risk GIST and provided guidance on adjuvant therapy for the first time. For general high-risk patients, 3 years of adjuvant imatinib is adequate, whereas very high-risk patients benefit significantly from more than 5 years of adjuvant imatinib."

At the same time, long-term food supply statistics from the FAOSTAT database show that these recommendations were at the root of fundamental dietary changes in Western countries, which resulted in a lower consumption of eggs and red meat, a higher consumption of cereals and poultry, a decline in average protein quality and, overall, in a higher glycemic load of the diet. Because current views on human nutrition are based primarily on highly unreliable questionnaire data from observational studies, the purpose of this commentary is to provide an alternative ecological (country-level) perspective and to trace the consequences of these nutritional changes using the FAOSTAT database in combination with available anthropological and health statistics. This comparison shows a close connection between the decline in protein quality and the sudden reversal of the positive height trend in some Western countries, after ∼150 years of continuous growth, which points to suboptimal levels of child nutrition. The sharp increase in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes is strongly correlated with the increasing consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrates and sweeteners, and is also interconnected with the decrease in body height, because a high-quality, growth-stimulating diet during adolescence is inversely related to obesity. Given the long-term association between height and phenotypic IQ, the lower quality of nutrients in children's diet may also seriously affect intellectual potential and future civilizational development. In light of these findings, current nutritional strategies should be seriously reconsidered and recommended protein intakes for children must be urgently reevaluated."

However, the dynamics of A1M in chronic kidney disease patients being susceptible to oxidative stress remain unclear. The present study aimed to determine the profile and changes in A1M resulting from blood purification in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) (including hemodiafiltration). Eighteen patients on stable maintenance HD were included in the study. For analysis, residual serum samples were collected from these patients during routine blood tests. A1M was measured using a latex agglutination immunoassay. The abundance of the free and bound forms of A1M was determined by native PAGE. The A1M concentration was 91.58 ± 26.34 mg/L, the percentage of free A1M was 72.62 ± 20.02%. The pre- and postdialysis mean concentration of free A1M were 68.74 ± 29.78 and 52.13 ± 22.48 mg/L, respectively.

These drinks typically contain a variety of components, each of which has been shown to offer individual benefits. However, the combined effects of these components, as formulated in many sports drinks, have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to evaluate the impact of typical sports drink components on endurance performance, perceived exertion, and carbohydrate and fat metabolism, using a sequential additive design.\n\nMETHODS: Twelve healthy, trained endurance athletes aged 20 to 35 years participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study involved a baseline assessment and four exercise protocols, each separated by a 7-day washout period. During each exercise protocol, participants cycled for 40 minutes at 80% of their previously determined peak oxygen uptake , followed by an incremental protocol performed to voluntary exhaustion. Participants were randomly assigned to ingest one of four 300 ml solutions 60 and 30 minutes before each exercise protocol: solution A (placebo mineral water), solution B (dextrose and sodium), solution C (solution B + beetroot extract), or solution D (solution C + arginine and L-citrulline). Ventilation and heart rate were continuously monitored before and throughout the exercise. Lactate and glucose levels were measured at specific time points before and during the exercise, while ratings of perceived exertion were recorded every 10 minutes. Power output was continuously tracked throughout the exercise protocol. Body weight was assessed both before and after each exercise session.\n\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences between the four solutions in terms of time to exhaustion (\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The effect of the tested sports drink compositions on performance during the selected exercise protocol to voluntary exhaustion appears minimal. This study found no significant differences between the solutions and the placebo. Thus, it can be concluded that consuming a dextrose-based solution before exercise did not offer any performance advantage over water. The additional substances included in solutions B, C, and D did not influence performance, carbohydrate metabolism, or fat metabolism during the exercise."

While apelin peptides are promising therapeutic candidates due to their critical role in vascular homeostasis, their efficacy as agonists is limited by insufficient lesion-specific targeting and suboptimal in vivo stability. Here, we developed an engineered extracellular vesicle (EV) platform for precise apelin delivery to PAH lesions, maximizing therapeutic impact. Using interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), a type II transmembrane protein, we oriented the apelin peptide on the EV surface with its C-terminus fully exposed, preserving the critical binding interface for functional interaction with the apelin receptor. To further enhance targeting specificity, we integrated the PAH-targeting peptide CARSKNKDC (CAR), which selectively binds to heparan sulfate overexpressed on PAH endothelial cells, into the IFITM3-apelin scaffold, creating CAR-Apelin EVs. This dual-engineered EVs demonstrated exceptional targeting and therapeutic efficacy in PAH models. CAR-Apelin EVs significantly reversed pathological vascular remodeling and improved cardiac function, as evidenced by reduced right ventricular systolic pressure and hypertrophy. Our findings establish CAR-Apelin EVs as a transformative therapeutic strategy, providing a targeted and effective approach to meet critical unmet needs in PAH treatment."

Nevertheless, its role in the progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) remains to be elucidated.\n\nMETHODS: We identified the differentially expressed genes in the glomeruli of IgAN patients through weighted gene co-expression network analysis across three datasets. Through clinical renal pathological tissue and cellular experiments, we further validated the gene and investigated its relationship with the inflammatory markers and fibrosis indicators in IgAN.\n\nRESULTS: Compared to peritumoral normal tissues, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) signaling pathway have been identified as key elements in IgAN pathogenesis from two GEO databases and a validation dataset. PCK1 was identified and validated as one of the most promising candidate genes. The expression of PCK1 in clinically collected kidney specimens was significantly downregulated in patients with IgAN compared to healthy controls. The expression of PCK1 was inversely correlated with clinical indicators such as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, 24-hour proteinuria. In experiments with SV40-transformed mouse glomerular mesangial cells (MCs), PCK1 and PPARγ protein expression levels were significantly decreased in polymeric IgA1 (pIgA1)-stimulated MCs, which contrasts with the increased expression of inflammatory and fibrotic factors. Overexpression of PCK1 inhibited cellular inflammation and fibrotic changes induced by pIgA1, demonstrating protective effects against cellular fibrosis similar to rosiglitazone.\n\nCONCLUSION: PCK1 exerted a pronounced inhibitory effect on mesangial cell inflammatory markers and fibrosis indicators in IgAN, potentially offering a novel therapeutic target for its treatment."

    "text": "Gliadins are allergenic proteins that can pose various risks to human health and are found in high amounts in the most commonly consumed foods. Gliadin, a component of gluten, triggers oxidative stress in celiac disease. Using sensitive analytical methods, especially in foods containing high amounts of these proteins, is crucial for food safety. Aptamer-based biosensors are widely preferred in electroanalytical methods. One of the promising approaches regarding biosensors is the studies in which aptamer-based sensors are combined with molecularly imprinted polymers. The antibody-like binding and ability of MIP to distinguish between molecules increases the method's selectivity. Using a platform modified with aptamer and molecularly imprinted polymer hybrid (MIP) as a new synthetic receptor film, this study presents a selective and sensitive label-free aptasensor for detecting a food allergy gliadin. For this purpose, screen printed gold electrode was used. The electrode surface was electrochemically coated with gold nanoparticles to bind the aptamer to the surface; then the aptamer-gliadin complex was dripped onto the surface and adhered to it, then, o-phenylene diamine monomer was used to synthesize a MIP surface. Gliadin was determined by using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in a wide range from 0.25 fg/mL to 1000 pg/mL. The developed method calculated LOD for gliadin determination as 0.011 fg/mL and LOQ as 0.034 fg/mL. The devised aptasensor was not only capable to the discrimination of the commonly found allergen compounds such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), casein, and ara-H1, but also it could detect the gliadin in spiked real samples such as gluten-free bread, crackers, cookies and brown rice cakes samples in the high recovery range of 98.1-104.6 %. The method could be a promising candidate for the sensitive determination of several allergens in food sample analysis."

Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and Stata 17.0, with effect sizes expressed as weighted mean differences (WMDs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\n\nRESULTS: A total of 18 RCTs involving 1,497 patients were analyzed. Combination therapy significantly improved total effective rate (TER) (MD 2.61, 95% CI 1.62-2.64) and reduced key renal and metabolic markers. Urinary protein excretion rate (UPER), serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 24-hour urinary protein (24h-UTP), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) levels all significantly decreased in the combination group. Subgroup analysis showed that patients aged ≤55 years had greater reductions in SCr (WMD -25.62, 95% CI -29.41 to -21.83) and BUN (WMD -2.51, 95% CI -2.75 to -2.27). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of findings. No publication bias was detected for TER, SCr, BUN, 24h-UTP, TG, and adverse reactions, though UPER and TC showed potential bias.\n\nCONCLUSION: SKI combined with RAAS blockers may enhance renal function and metabolic profiles in DN patients. Further high-quality RCTs are needed to validate these findings and assess long-term safety."

In vivo, renal function was assessed via serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, and creatinine clearance measurements, alongside histopathological evaluation of renal fibrosis and inflammation. In vitro, hypoxia-treated HK-2 cells were analyzed for fibrotic markers (fibronectin, collagen I, α-smooth muscle actin) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-18). Molecular mechanisms were probed through protein expression analysis of HIF-1α and the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, with NLRP3 inflammasome activity evaluated.\n\nRESULTS: SSR treatment significantly improved renal function in CRF rats, reducing serum creatinine (Scr) and urea nitrogen (BUN) while enhancing creatinine clearance. Histopathology revealed preserved renal architecture with attenuated fibrosis and inflammatory infiltration. In hypoxic HK-2 cells, SSR downregulated fibrotic markers and suppressed IL-1β and IL-18 levels.

In this study, we developed a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) method for identifying inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 NP-RNA interaction. Using this HTRF-based approach, we identified two natural products, sennoside A and sennoside B, as effective blockers of this interaction. Bio-layer interferometry assays confirmed that both sennosides directly bind to the NP, with binding sites located within the C-terminal domain. Additionally, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments revealed that sennoside B significantly inhibited RNA-induced LLPS of the NP, while sennoside A displayed comparatively weaker activity. Thus, the developed HTRF-based assay is a valuable tool for identifying novel compounds that disrupt the RNA-binding activity and LLPS of the SARS-CoV-2 NP.

Human proximal tubular cells (HK-2 cells) were treated with TGF-β1 to induce fibrosis (50 ng/mL for 24 h), followed by Tan IIA treatment (5 μM) for an additional 3 h.\n\nRESULTS: Tan IIA significantly reduced the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including collagen I, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), vimentin and fibronectin, in UUO mice. Tan IIA attenuated GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis. However, in GSDMD knockout mice subjected to UUO, the protective effects of Tan IIA on ECM gene expression and collagen deposition in the tubular interstitium were reduced.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Tan IIA may mitigate GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) and reduce kidney fibrosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic strategy to prevent the progression of kidney disease after ureteral obstruction."

Despite advancements in cancer therapies, challenges such as cellular toxicity and drug resistance to chemotherapy persist. Regulated cell death (RCD), once regarded as a passive process, is now recognized as a programmed mechanism with distinct biochemical and morphological characteristics, thereby presenting new therapeutic opportunities. Ferroptosis, a novel form of RCD characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and unique mitochondrial damage, differs from apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis. It is driven by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced lipid peroxidation and is implicated in tumorigenesis, anti-tumor immunity, and resistance, particularly in tumors undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, ferroptosis is associated with ischemic organ damage, degenerative diseases, and aging, regulated by various cellular metabolic processes, including redox balance, iron metabolism, and amino acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism. This review focuses on the role of epigenetic factors in tumor ferroptosis, exploring their mechanisms and potential applications in cancer therapy. It synthesizes current knowledge to provide a comprehensive understanding of epigenetic regulation in tumor cell ferroptosis, offering insights for future research and clinical applications."

However, previous research shows they commonly experience suboptimal intakes of energy and carbohydrate. To date, little research has been conducted to understand the causes of their poor dietary intakes. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess infantry trainees' dietary intakes and (2) explore their beliefs, barriers, and self-efficacy toward performance nutrition using the Health Belief Model (HBM).\n\nMETHODS: Participants undergoing their 17-week Australian Army Infantry Initial Employment Training (Infantry IET) were recruited. During weeks 1 and 17, self-reported dietary intakes were assessed, and four focus groups were conducted.\n\nRESULTS: Mean daily energy, carbohydrate, and protein intakes were 7864 ± 1135 kJ, 1.8 ± 0.6 g/kg, and 1.5 ± 0.3 g/kg, respectively, in week 1, and 9084 ± 2535 kJ/day, 2.2 ± 1.1 g/kg and 1.5 ± 0.2 g/kg, respectively, in week 17. Three themes and seven subthemes were developed from the focus group data, falling under the following HBM domains: Cues to Action, Perceived Barriers, and Self-Efficacy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Infantry trainees' ability to eat well for their health and performance was hindered by their limited time during their intensive training schedule, their limited access to a sufficient variety of healthy foods, and their limited self-efficacy regarding performance nutrition. They require further performance nutrition knowledge, especially in regard to adopting practical fueling and refueling strategies surrounding physical training, as well as access to a greater quantity and variety of healthy foods outside of their main mealtimes."

Subjects received a fourth dose of PHH-1V after either two BNT162b2 doses plus one PHH-1V dose (cohort 1) or three BNT162b2 doses (cohort 2). As regulatory endpoint, neutralization titers were investigated for PHH-1 V as fourth dose vs BNT162b2 as third dose in subjects receiving previous BNT162b2-based regimens. PHH-1 V immunogenicity (GMT) was investigated against Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1, BA.4/5 and XBB.1.5 on Days 14, 98 and 182 post-immunization. Two hundred and eighty-eight subjects received PHH-1V. Neutralizing antibodies against Omicron BA.1 at Day 14 significantly increased after the PHH-1V as fourth booster vs the third BNT162b2 booster (GMT ratio 0.43 (95% CI: 0.28; 0.65; p-value < .0001)). PHH-1V fourth booster induced a significant increase in neutralizing titers vs baseline (GMFR on Day 14 [95% CI]: Beta 6.96 [5.23, 9.25]; Delta 6.27 [4.79, 8.22]; Omicron BA.1 9.21 [5.57, 15.21]; Omicron BA.4/5 11.80 [8.29, 16.80]; Omicron XBB.1.5 5.22 [3.97, 6.87]), remaining significantly higher up to 6 months.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate supplement use among Polish athletes, considering their competitive level and gender. Additionally, it assessed whether athletes select supplements in accordance with the AIS classification and examined their awareness of supplement certification programs.\n\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study included 659 Polish athletes (309 women, 350 men) from various sports, representing both professional (57.7%) and nonprofessional (42.3%) levels. An online questionnaire was used to assess dietary supplement consumption, sources of information regarding supplementation, and knowledge of anti-doping and supplement certification programs. Supplement use was categorized according to the AIS classification (Groups A - D). Statistical analyses, including chi-square tests and Mann - Whitney U tests, were conducted to evaluate differences between professional and nonprofessional athletes, as well as between male and female participants.\n\nRESULTS: A high prevalence of dietary supplement use (91.1%) was observed among Polish athletes, with no significant differences between professional (95.8%) and nonprofessional (94.3%) athletes or between men (92.0%) and women (90.0%).

Following our previous WDEB analysis, the purpose of this investigation was to assess dietary macronutrient intake as related to RDAs (USDA and IOC/ISSN), within-day macronutrient timing, and associated sex differences in swimmers.\n\nMETHODS: In elite male and female swimmers (\n\nRESULTS: When compared to IOC/ISSN daily recommendations, only 6/25 swimmers met FAT intake, 7/25 met CHO intake, and 24/25 met PRO intake IOC/ISSN daily recommendations.Males had greater EI and TDEE compared to females (\n\nCONCLUSION: The results from this study demonstrate significant sex-differences, indicating that most swimmers meet athlete-specific recommendations for PRO, but not CHO or FAT intake. CHO timing for pre-, during, and post-exercise was met by only 52% swimmers. Results suggest that swimmers should prioritize CHO intake, emphasized around and during training bouts."

GO and GSEA-KEGG enrichment analyses were used to identify key biological functions and related pathways. Cytoscape software was used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to obtain hub genes. The Nephroseq database was used to analyze the effect of hub genes on renal function, and the importance of lumican, a gene potentially related to DN progression, was further examined in clinical samples. GO and KEGG analyses were performed on lumican and its interacting proteins to elucidate their main biological functions and related pathways.\n\nRESULTS: We identified 1139 DEGs. GO enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly involved in responses to hexose, cell-cell junctions. GSEA-KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the DEGs were related to amino acid metabolism, adipokine signaling. Nephroseq database analysis revealed that hub genes were upregulated in the kidney tissues of patients with DN and that their expression was negatively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Lumican was among the top hub genes, and its expression was increased in renal tissues of DN patients as confirmed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that lumican and its interacting proteins were associated with extracellular matrix organization.\n\nCONCLUSION: Lumican is a potential biomarker for predicting DN and is closely related to the extracellular matrix.

It is categorized as ribosomopathy related to heterozygous allelic variations in ribosomal protein (RP) genes. Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is a rare and etiologically heterogeneous condition, defined by the clinical triad of micrognathia, glossoptosis, and cleft palate.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We present a 5-year-and-2-month-old Chinese boy diagnosed with DBA combined with RPS. He was born with micrognathia, cleft palate, and airway obstruction, resulting in neonatal asphyxia and feeding difficulties, which constitute the classic triad of PRS. Low-set ears, downslanted palpebral fissures, bilateral exotropia, a short neck, hypertelorism, a thenar muscle defect, and bilateral severe sensorineural hearing loss were also observed in the boy. His motor and speech development were significantly delayed. In addition, he was found to be granulocytopenic at birth and severely anemic at 2 years and 10 months of age. Whole exome sequencing of peripheral blood revealed a heterozygous mutation in the RPS28 gene (c.2T > C, p.Met1?), a novel pathogenic mutation in RPS28. RPS28 is one of the ribosomal protein (RP) genes, which may contribute to DBA-related phenotypes. The boy underwent HSCT from 9/10 HLA-matched donor and his neutrophil and hemoglobin levels returned to normal.\n\nCONCLUSION: It is crucial to perform a genetic evaluation for syndromic bone marrow failure with congenital anomalies. A heterozygous mutation in the RPS28 gene (c.2T > C, p.Met1?) is a novel pathogenic mutation associated with DBA. HSCT is an effective treatment for hematological abnormalities in DBA."

Cross-sectional analysis was performed after collecting demographic data, dialysis-related data, laboratory parameters, and body composition data from MHD patients.\n\nRESULTS: In MHD patients, the PEW group exhibited lower levels of hemoglobin (Hb), albumin (ALB), transferrin (TF), creatinine (Cr), triglycerides (TG), prealbumin (PALB), soft lean mass (SLM), body mass index (BMI), percent of body fat (PBF), arm muscle circumference (AMC), and phase angle (PHA) compared to the non-PEW group, while C-reactive protein (CRP) and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels, as well as Extracellular Water/Total Body Water (ECW/TBW) ratio, were higher in the PEW group than in the non-PEW group. After full adjustment, TMAO and ECW/TBW ratio were independent risk factors for PEW in MHD patients. Further, plasma TMAO levels correlated negatively with Cr, ALB, Hb, BMI, and PHA, and positively with ECW/TBW in MHD patients with PEW.

This study aimed to describe the macronutrient intake of professional male rugby players at Zebre Rugby Club in Parma, Italy, during in-season, and to compare players' macronutrient intake to international recommendations.\n\nMETHODS: Thirty-four professional male rugby players participated in the cross-sectional study. A self-developed questionnaire, a food frequency questionnaire and food records (on training and competition days and off day) were used to investigate players' macronutrient intake. Anthropometric measurements were obtained using the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) standardized techniques. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and associations were investigated using chi-square, Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank tests as applicable.\n\nRESULTS: The players' median age was 25.8 years (range 20.6-33.0 years) and 47.5% were Italian. Most players (64.7%) held forward positions and had a median of 5 years (range 2-14 years) of professional experience.

The forwards weighed heavier (\n\nCONCLUSION: The study's findings can assist various stakeholders at Zebre Rugby Club to align rugby players' dietary requirements to their workload, and encourage players' adherence to dietary guidelines and recommendations. It is advised that attention be focused on accurate dietary education, intake and monitoring to promote individualization and optimal performance and recovery. Future research is needed to adapt standardized macronutrient recommendations for rugby-specific requirements and address obstacles that may impede the optimal intake of macronutrients."

Comprehensive analyses of plasma cytokines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and spatial immune cell patterns in liver biopsies were performed to identify unique immune signatures resulting from the combined therapy. The combination of pembrolizumab and XL888 proved to be safe and feasible, with a subset of patients achieving stable disease, although no objective responses were observed in this heavily pre-treated population.

    "text": "Following an extensive literature review, the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) has developed an official position on nutritional and weight cut strategies for combat sports. The type of combat sport, length of the fight camp, and time between weigh-in and competition are factors influencing nutritional and weight cut strategies. The following 16 points constitute the Position Statement of the Society; the Research Committee has approved them. 1. Combat sports have differing weight categories, official weigh-in times, and competition frequencies, influencing the nutritional and weight cut strategies for training and competition. 2. As the duration of a combat match increases, >4 min, contribution of the aerobic system can rise to >70%, yet anaerobic alactic pathways and anaerobic glycolytic pathways support high-output bursts. 3. During the off camp/general preparation phase, athletes should maintain a weight ranging 12% to 15% above the weight division requirement. 4. Supplements including creatine, beta-alanine, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, and caffeine have been shown to enhance performance and/or recovery during preparation phases, competition, and post-competition. 5. During fight camp, strategic decreases in calorie intake are necessary for an efficient longitudinal weight descent. Individual caloric needs can be determined using indirect calorimetry or validated equations such as Mifflin St. Jeor or Cunningham. 6. Protein should be prioritized during longitudinal weight descents to preserve lean body mass, and the timely delivery of carbohydrates supports training demands. Macronutrients should not drop below the following: carbohydrates 3.0-4.0 g/kg, protein 1.2-2.0 g/kg, and fat 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg/day. 7. Suitable losses in body mass range from 6.7% at 72 h, 5.7% at 48 h, and 4.4% at 24 h, prior to weigh-in. 8. Sodium restriction and water loading are effective for inducing polyuria and acute water loss. 9. During fight week, water-bound glycogen stores can be depleted through exercise and carbohydrate restriction, facilitating a 1% to 2% loss in body mass, with equivalent losses from a low-fiber intake of <10 g/day for 4 days. 10. During fight week, acute water loss strategies, including sauna, hot water immersion, and mummy wraps, can be used effectively with appropriate supervision (optimally ~2-4% of body mass within 24 h of weigh-in). 11. Post-weigh-in, rapid weight gain strategies are utilized to recover lost body fluid/mass before competition with the intent of gaining a competitive advantage. 12. Oral rehydration solutions (1 to 1.5 liters/h) combined with a sodium range of 50-90 mmol/dL should take precedence immediately post-weigh-in. 13. Fast-acting carbohydrates at a tolerable rate of ≤ 60 g/h should follow oral rehydration solutions. Post weigh-in intake of fiber should be limited to avoid gastrointestinal distress. 14. Post-weigh-in carbohydrate intake at 8-12 g/kg may be appropriate for combat athletes that undertook significant glycogen depletion strategies during fight week. About 4-7 g/kg may be suitable for modest carbohydrate restriction. 15. Post weigh-in, rehydration/refueling protocols should aim to regain ≥10% of body mass to mitigate declines in performance and the negative effects of rapid weight loss. 16. The long-term effects of frequent weight cuts on health and performance are unknown, necessitating further research."

We presented a comprehensive overview of the detection techniques for RPs. Current methods to quantify RPs in clinical routine are flow cytometry and fully automated hematology analyzers (Sysmex-XE/XN, Abbott, ADVIA, Mindray), which make the detection of RPs simpler, faster and more affordable. The proportion of RPs increased in the circulation has potential diagnostic and prognostic values in multiple clinical settings (risk stratification in cardiovascular diseases, the effect on antiplatelet drugs, differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia, monitor platelet recovery after bone marrow or stem cell transplantation, and other diseases). There have been several studies focusing on RPs in recent years, particularly in cardiovascular disease and thrombocytopenia.

    "text": "Recent studies have confirmed the significant potential of the histamine H2 receptor (H2R) as a therapeutic target for multiple diseases, creating an urgent demand for efficient drug screening methodologies. To address this need, we developed an innovative technique utilizing immobilized H2R for the rapid identification and characterization of bioactive compounds from complex matrices. Compared with the previous screening methods, this approach can detect the binding mode of ligands on the basis of screening. In this study, the prepared H2R chromatographic column was successfully applied for kinetic interaction analysis between two specific ligands and the receptor. The bioactive compound screened and collected via the H2R column was identified as liquiritin using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ion trap mass spectrometry (HPLC-IT-MS). Competitive displacement assays revealed that liquiritin competes with nizatidine and ranitidine for the same binding sites. Notably, as the concentration of famotidine in the mobile phase increased, an inverse shift in the retention time of liquiritin was observed. To elucidate this phenomenon, molecular docking simulations were performed. The results suggest that nizatidine and ranitidine compete with liquiritin for the same binding sites, reducing liquiritin-protein binding and increasing the proportion of free liquiritin, thereby causing a forward shift in the retention peak. In contrast, the acidic residues (ASP186, ASP98) of famotidine may reorganize the protein's surface charge through salt bridges or hydrogen bonds, altering the electrostatic interactions of liquiritin and leading to the observed peak shift. Additionally, at higher concentrations, famotidine may form multimolecular complexes that indirectly stabilize liquiritin-protein binding. Literature review revealed that, compared to nizatidine and ranitidine, famotidine exhibits a positive regulatory effect on β-arrestin-mediated receptor desensitization and internalization. These findings further demonstrate that the established H2R receptor chromatography model can effectively screen bioactive components and determine their binding modes. This study lays the foundation for screening bioactive compounds from traditional Chinese medicines using receptor chromatography and provides preliminary insights into their mechanisms of action."

DKR was calculated using the formula: (0.9 × fat +0.46 × protein) / (0.1 × fat +0.58 × protein + carbohydrates). Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for 19 confounders (demographics, comorbidities, lifestyle), restricted cubic splines, and mediation analyses. Robustness was assessed via propensity score matching.\n\nRESULTS: A higher DKR showed a linear dose-response reduction in depressive symptoms risk (OR = 0.13 per unit increase, 95 % CI:0.03-0.48, p = 0.003; Q4 vs. Q1 OR = 0.59, p = 0.012)..

None of the 12 inflammatory markers showed significant mediation, as indicated by p-values >0.05 or mediation proportions <5 %.\n\nCONCLUSION: DKR inversely associates with depressive symptoms risk, potentially through body composition remodeling rather than anti-inflammatory pathways. ABSI served as a positive mediator in the inverse association between DKR and depressive symptoms. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm causality and clinical utility of DKR."

The cellular and protein level results confirmed that SMU-C68 facilitated the dimerization of TLR1 and TLR2 proteins, leading to the specific activation of TLR1/2 heterodimers. Upon activation, TLR2 recruited the adaptor protein MyD88, initiating downstream NF-κB signaling pathway.

    "text": "Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most aggressive primary brain malignancy with a 10 % three-year survival rate. Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) has emerged as a critical factor in the progression of GBM progression, invasion, and treatment resistance. However, small molecule inhibitors targeting CHI3L1 are largely unexplored. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) investigation of the direct binding potential of reported CHI3L1 modulators (K284, G721-0282, CHI3L1-IN-1) revealed modest to undetectable direct CHI3L1 binding affinity. Herein, pharmacophore-based virtual screening of in-house library resulted in the discovery of G28 as the most potent small molecule CHI3L1 binder reported to date. The CHI3L1 binding affinity of G28 was validated using MST and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). To evaluate the GBM-modulatory potential of G28, we conducted comprehensive pharmacokinetic and 3D spheroid studies alongside established CHI3L1 modulators. G28 demonstrated outstanding bioavailability and low toxicity, addressing key limitations faced by previous CHI3L1-targeted strategies. Notably, in 3D GBM spheroid models, G28 significantly outperformed reported CHI3L1 small molecule modulators, showing the most pronounced dose-dependent reductions in spheroid weight, migration, and viability. These findings position G28 as the most promising CHI3L1-targeted small molecule to date and a compelling candidate for GBM therapeutic development."

Using the SARS-CoV-2 nAb as a proof-of-concept target, this system comprised a hybrid probe with the viral RBD as an antigen module covalently conjugated to a reporter DNA, and magnetic beads functionalized with the ACE2 mimic mini-protein as a receptor module, thereby recapitulating the natural antigen-receptor interactions. With this design, the neutralizing capability of nAb against the antigen was transformed into a competitive reduction of the probe binding and DNA amplification signal by qPCR. The NAD-qPCR demonstrated robust performance in quantifying commercial SARS-CoV-2 nAb with a LOD of 4 ng/μL. Furthermore, it was demonstrated to be capable of effectively profiling a large number of vaccinated donor serum with broad neutralization activity. Notably, the hybrid probe and the capture beads were designed modularly, which allows for straightforward adaptation to other pathogens by replacing the module component. This platform offers a rapid, high-throughput, and universally applicable approach for nAb detection in vaccine development and immune monitoring."

The primary hypothesis of this study was that oxidative damage, caused in vivo by oxidative stress-a key factor in aging and various inflammatory diseases-deteriorates bone tissue quality by damaging bone collagen, the main component of the bone's organic phase. To test this hypothesis in vitro, bovine cortical bone specimens were exposed to neutral hypochlorous acid solution (a potent reactive oxygen species) to induce oxidative damage, which was measured in terms of carbonylation. Carbonylation is a stable biomarker of protein oxidation. Mechanical testing revealed degradation of cortical bone mechanical properties due to oxidation. There was a marked degradation of mechanical properties, specifically pre-yield and post-yield properties such as tensile (30-40 %) and compressive (19-23 %) yield strength, as well as tensile (25-45 %) and compressive (11-16 %) ultimate strength. Exposure to neutral hypochlorous acid solutions increased the carbonyl content (normalized to collagen content), confirming protein oxidative damage. In addition, the observed carbonyl levels in the oxidized groups were similar to those measured in human cortical bone specimens. Thermo-analytical tests including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and hydrothermal isothermal tension (HIT) tests, providing measures of collagen nativity and connectivity, revealed negative correlations with carbonyl content (r = -0.46, p = 0.0038). The hypothesis that physiological levels of oxidative damage generated in vitro degrade cortical bone mechanical properties by damaging the bone collagen has been confirmed. This suggests that oxidative damage of bone collagen is important towards understanding the degradation of bone quality in aging and various diseases."

This study investigates the interaction between proteins and structurally different nitrocellulose (CN) membranes and the resulting effects on signal intensity in an LFA under the influence of various buffer additives. The experiments focused on quantitative protein adsorption, protein stability, protein line printing and changes in signal intensity in a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-assay. A method was established for detecting the widths and intensities of fluorescent protein lines. We were able to show that changes in signal intensity of LFAs are driven by accessibility of the antibodies, by hydrophilicity of the membrane or assisted adsorption of antibodies onto the membrane. Additionally, the inclusion of sodium chloride, polysorbate 80 and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate can enhance signal intensity. The method developed for protein line analysis has proven to be effective and can help to understand protein-membrane-interactions on a macroscopic level. We demonstrate that LFA-manufacturers have a range of options to fine-tune assay performance without major modifications to assay components."

We assessed the performance of tosyl-activated magnetic beads versus sheep antibody beads, identifying the optimal bead type for enhanced binding efficiency. Various elution conditions were rigorously tested to maximize protein yield. We also evaluated a range of antibodies specific to α-synuclein and delineated the effects of antibody amount and bead volume on the recovery of α-synuclein.

    "text": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Rhinoviruses are major causes of respiratory infections and often aggravate conditions such as asthma. The protein 3C protease plays a crucial role as it blocks the virus replication. This study explores the potential of natural inhibitors, specifically Propolis compounds targeting the protein 3Cpro, which is a promising and less toxic alternative compared to the standard synthetic inhibitor, Rupintrivir.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: A set of 60 propolis-derived molecules was selected and prepared for molecular docking simulations to evaluate their binding affinity to 3Cpro, then ligand-3Cpro protein interactions were visualized. A 200ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted to assess the stability of the protein-ligand complexes, then the following MD parameters were analyzed: RMSD, RMSF, SASA, Rg, and hydrogen bonding. Binding free energies were further estimated using MM-PBSA, and per-residue energy decomposition was performed to identify key stabilizing interactions.\n\nRESULTS: The potential compounds Rutin and Retusapurpurin A displayed binding energies of -8.0 kcal/mol and -8.78 kcal/mol, respectively, outperforming the reference inhibitor Rupintrivir (-6.66 kcal/mol). MD simulations revealed that both ligands effectively stabilize 3Cpro, with RMSD scores of 1.02 ± 0.10 nm and 1,21 ± 0.22, respectively, and are also more stable in the pocket than Rupintrivir. These ligands also reduced RMSF, SASA, and Rg scores. MM-PBSA calculations showed more favorable binding energies for Rutin (-35.65 kcal/mol) and Retusapurpurin A (-31.59 kcal/mol) compared to Rupintrivir (-25.44 kcal/mol). Per-residue decomposition further revealed strong energetic contributions from catalytic site residues (His40, Glu71, and Cys147), especially in the Rutin complex.\n\nCONCLUSION: The potential compounds Rutin and Retusapurpurin A are promising inhibitors targeting 3Cpro, exhibiting elevated potential efficacy compared to Rupintrivir. These results pave the way for the development of natural antivirals derived from Propolis and support its use as a dietary supplement for the treatment of rhinovirus infections. The chemical diversity of Propolis could limit the emergence of viral resistance. However, in vitro and in vivo experimental validation is required to confirm these observations."

Static DNA nanodevices have been engineered for the imaging and therapy, but they rely on the pre-assembly of DNA components and are limited by the low imaging contrast. Herein, we demonstrate the tumor microenvironment-responsive dynamic self-assembly of DNAzyme nanowires for high-contrast imaging of multiple mRNAs and chemotherapy. We design a cruciform DNA module (C-model) as a basic structural unit of DNAzyme nanowire, which consists of two DNAzyme strands and two substrate strands with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) being inserted into the C-models by inlaying between guanine and cytosine. Once approaching tumor cells, C-models with two split i-motif spontaneously assemble into a DNAzyme nanowire through protonation-driven Hoogsteen interaction in response to extracellular acidic microenvironments. Upon the internalization, intracellular TK1 mRNA and GalNAc-T mRNA hybridize with the overhangs of DNAzyme strands and substrate strands to form a stable DNAzyme/substrate/target three-way junction, inducing the cleavage of substrates by DNAzymes and the recovery of Cy5/Texas Red fluorescence. AS1411 aptamer-functionalized DOX-nanowires can selectively endocytose into cancer cells via AS1411-mediated recognition of nucleolin overexpressed on the cancer cell surface. Notably, the dynamic self-assembly of DNAzyme nanowires is characterized by efficient intracellular delivery and intrinsic resistance to nucleases, facilitating the high-contrast imaging of mRNAs. This method can accurately measure TK1 mRNA and GalNAc-T mRNA in living cells and discriminate multiple mRNAs in breast cancer tissues and their normal counterparts, providing a powerful platform for clinical diagnosis."

Participants completed self-reported questionnaires on demographic characteristics, physical health, activity levels, dietary index scores, dietary habits, and depressive symptoms.\n\nRESULTS: Participants were female (OR: 1.38, 95 % CI: 1.30-1.46), divorced or widowed (OR: 1.56, 95 % CI: 1.31-1.85), had a higher waist-hip ratio, and (OR: 2.22; 95 % CI: 1.43-3.43) and engaged in prolonged sedentary time (OR: 1.51; 95 % CI: 1.41-1.62) were more likely to report depressive symptoms.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations enable a platform to efficiently visualize and quantify the bound-unbound states of these ligand molecules in the presence of applied harmonic forces. We investigate the unbinding of Ritonavir, XK263, and AHA001 molecules from the HIV-1 protease dimer using an all-atom Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulation that induces an external stimulus as a constant harmonic force. The potential of mean force (PMF) calculations from the trajectories generated by SMD simulations show insights into the free energy landscape associated with the ligand's dissociation from HIV-1 protease, including the energetic barriers and favorable interactions involved in the process. Our results show that Ritonavir, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA), USA approved antiretroviral drug for HIV-1, has enhanced binding strength, followed by AHA001, which also shows a strong binding affinity comparable to many other FDA-approved drugs, as evidenced by the binding free energy calculations derived from Umbrella Sampling (US) simulations. The transient variations of corresponding protein-ligand interaction energies and calculations for hydrogen bond formation agree with the earlier findings.

The presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, pathological hallmarks of PD primarily composed of aggregated α-Syn, further underscores its critical involvement. This correlation has led to the hypothesis that α-Syn aggregation actively contributes to PD development. Recent studies have implicated oligomers formed during the initial phases of protein aggregation as the primary neurotoxic agents driving cellular degeneration in PD. This pathological process worsens mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and microglial activation, ultimately contributing to SNpc degeneration and PD progression. Currently, available PD medications only provide symptomatic relief and do not address underlying neuropathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, α-syn aggregation, or SNpc degeneration. Moreover, long-term use of anti-PD drugs like L-DOPA can lead to motor complications and systemic side effects. As a result, repurposing traditional herbal medicines with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties presents a promising therapeutic approach. Studies suggest that berberine (BBR) may mitigate PD-related neuropathology. However, the exact mechanisms by which BBR exerts its neuroprotective effects remain unclear. This review explores the potential molecular pathways through which BBR could alleviate PD pathology."

Finally, we assessed the therapeutic potential of the identified proteins via molecular docking studies.\n\nRESULTS: MR analysis revealed causal relationships between delirium and several aging-related indicators, including FI, IEAA, PhenoAge, and life expectancy. Eleven proteins were causally associated with delirium. Mediation analysis showed that the effects of HIBCH and IMPAD1 on delirium were mediated by PhenoAge, while IEAA mediated the effect of MICB. MST1's effect on delirium was mediated by FI and life expectancy. Bayesian colocalization confirmed strong associations between HIBCH, MST1, and delirium. Molecular docking studies indicated that MST1 and HIBCH exhibited low binding energies with midazolam and dexmedetomidine, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets.\n\nCONCLUSION: HIBCH and MST1 are key players in delirium pathophysiology and represent promising therapeutic candidates. Their involvement in delirium warrants further investigation in clinical research."

    "text": "In this study, we designed an efficient siRNA for PKMYT1 gene knockdown and evaluated the binding affinity of various natural small molecules to key proteins associated with breast cancer through molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Subsequently, among these molecules, The small molecule, SCHEMBL7562664, was introduced as a \"golden ligand\" that showed potent multi-target activity as an antagonist for aromatase, estrogen receptor α, HER2, and PARP10, and as an agonist for MT2 and STING. Next, MD simulations of six protein- golden ligand complexes (PDB IDs: 4QXQ, 5GS4, 5JL6, 5LX6, 6ME6, and 7PCD), performed with GROMACS over 100 ns at 298.15 K, provided valuable information about their structural dynamics. Analysis of the radius of gyration (Rg) revealed that, while five complexes (7PCD, 5GS4, 5LX6, 4QXQ, and 5JL6) maintained compact structures (Rg between 1.7 and 2.3 nm), the 6ME6 complex exhibited a more extended and flexible conformation (average Rg ∼3.4 nm). Complementary RMSD analysis confirmed that most complexes rapidly stabilized with minimal deviations (generally <0.3 nm), whereas the 6ME6 complex showed higher variability, reaching up to 0.67 nm. Furthermore, Binding free energy calculations using MM-GBSA and PBSA methods further supported these findings, with energies ranging from -21.45 ± 2.28 kcal/mol (5LX6) to -39.79 ± 1.34 kcal/mol (6ME6), indicating an optimal balance between intrinsic interactions and desolvation costs in the 6ME6 and 5JL6 systems. Based on DFT results, the golden ligand showed higher stability and lower reactivity compared to control ligands such as aromatase, tamoxifen, and dacomitinib, potentially leading to reduced off-target interactions and a more favorable safety profile. The integration of these data underscores the therapeutic potential of SCHEMBL7562664 as a multi-target agent for breast cancer, with promising pharmacokinetic properties that can be optimized for local treatment by incorporation into a 3D scaffold."

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) from astrocytes drive this process, yet the release mechanism, potentially involving extracellular vesicles (EVs), remains unclear. Rab27a releases EVs from multivesicular bodies (MVBs) by enabling their docking and fusion with the plasma membrane. We confirmed Rab27a expression, and its localization, subsequently, EV release was validated with CD9, Alix, and TSG101 markers. Rab27a-mediated EV release was confirmed in both Rab27a-induced and Rab27a-siRNA-treated cells. Rab27a-derived EVs inhibited neuronal cell growth, while Rab27a-siRNA EVs promoted neuronal growth. Our study also observed upregulated Rab27a expression in the rat contusion model of SCI. Further analysis showed increased CSPG expression in Rab27a-induced conditions via the Rho/ROCK pathway, with altered pAkt, and β-tubulin III, levels. Immunohistochemistry confirmed CSPG/Rab27a/GFAP and CSPG/CD9 co-localization in tissue sections, verifying that Rab27a mediates EV release containing CSPG from astrocytes. These findings suggest that Rab27a plays a crucial role in CSPG release via EVs and scar formation. Functional recovery was significantly improved with Rab27a-siRNA treatment, suggesting Rab27a as a potential target for astrocytic scar modulation in SCI. The study reveals the detailed mechanistic insight of Rab27a-dependent CSPG release via EVs for sub-acute scar formation in contusion SCI."

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and left atrial enlargement (LAE) on sac/val in patients with LVEF>40% and worsening HF.\n\nMETHODS: PARAGLIDE-HF patients were classified into 3 groups according the degree of structural abnormalities using LVH and LAE. The primary endpoint was time-averaged proportional change in NT-proBNP from baseline to Weeks 4 and 8. Secondary endpoints were recurrent cardiovascular composite events (HF hospitalizations, urgent HF visits, cardiovascular death) and adverse events (symptomatic hypotension, hyperkalemia, worsening renal function).\n\nRESULTS: Of 454 (97.4%) patients with LVH and LAE data, 157 (34.5%) had both LVH and LAE, 178 (39.2%) had either LVH or LAE, and 119 (26.2%) had neither LVH nor LAE. Greater reduction in NT-proBNP with sac/val vs val was consistent across groups (P interaction = 0.705). There was no significant interaction between treatment and degree of structural abnormalities for other efficacy endpoints. Patients with both LVH and LAE had significantly higher odds of hyperkalemia with sac/val (OR 2.41, P interaction = 0.024).\n\nCONCLUSION: Patients with LVEF>40% and recent WHF had greater reduction in NT-proBNP with sac/val vs val, regardless of the degree of structural abnormalities. There was no difference in the effects of sac/val on efficacy endpoints across structural abnormality group. Patients with both LVH and LAE had higher odds for hyperkalemia with sac/val."

Nevertheless, the inherent drawbacks of PROTAC technology hinder its clinical translation. The integration of nanotechnology with PROTAC molecules to create nano-PROTACs for combined therapy offers a promising solution. Among the various cancer treatment methods, phototherapy is considered the optimal choice to integrate with specific PROTACs due to its proven effectiveness and non-invasive nature. Herein, a nano-PROTAC formulation (ARV@PEG-ICG) consisting of a phototherapeutic agent named indocyanine green functionalized polyethylene glycol (PEG-ICG) and a BRD4 degrader (ARV-825) was fabricated for cancer photo-immunotherapy. Activated by acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), ARV@PEG-ICG nanoparticles (NPs) will decompose rapidly for ARV delivery. PEG-ICG generated abundant ROS with laser irradiation, downregulating the expression of Bcl-xL and inducing the cleavage of PARP to stimulate cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the degradation of BRD4, a transcriptional cofactor, inhibited nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) generation to improve phototherapeutic efficacy. In a 4T1 breast tumor model, dying 4T1 cells released tumor associated antigens (TAAs) to serve as the immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer, facilitating DC maturation and T cell activation and amplifying systemic immune response. The distant tumor growth can also be inhibited due to the activation of long-term immune response. Overall, the current study aims to combine typical PROTAC with functional nanomaterials to form nano-PROTAC with high performance for PROTAC delivery mediated cancer treatment."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors have emerged as a leading platform for gene therapy, supported by several FDA-approved products and numerous clinical trials. Due to their biological complexity and heterogeneity, rigorous analytical methods are essential to ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of rAAV-based products. Critical quality attributes (CQAs) such as aggregation, full/empty capsid ratios, viral protein composition, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) must be monitored comprehensively. While several chromatographic techniques address individual CQAs, there is a growing industrial need for techniques that enable multi-attribute analysis in a single run.\n\nRESULTS: In this study, we developed a multidimensional size-exclusion chromatography-ultraviolet detection-reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SEC-UV-RPLC-MS) method for the comprehensive characterization of rAAV vectors. The method enables simultaneous assessment of high molecular weight species (aggregates), capsid identity, and PTMs. In the first dimension, SEC separates intact viral particles and quantifies aggregates, followed by a targeted heart-cut of the monomeric fraction. This fraction is then subjected to RPLC for protein separation under denaturing conditions, with high-resolution MS used to identify viral proteins and their modifications. Initially optimized for rAAV8, the method was successfully extended to other rAAV serotypes, demonstrating its adaptability across serotypes. A forced degradation study under thermal stress conditions further highlighted the method's ability to monitor structural integrity and stability of the viral vectors.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: This study presents a novel 2D-LC-MS approach for streamlined, multi-attribute analysis of viral vector products. By combining multiple analyses into a single run, this 2D-LC-MS method can be considered as a powerful tool for comprehensive analysis of gene therapy vectors in the future. Potential applications include real-time in-process control, comparability studies, stability testing, support during process development for aggregate or PTM profiling, and drug substance or product characterization."

The inner layer consists of methacrylated chitosan (CSMA), incorporating polydopamine-coated silica (PDA-SiO₂) nanoparticles to form a hydrophilic sponge with hemostatic, antioxidant, and pro-angiogenic properties. The outer layer is a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanofiber membrane integrated with antibacterial agent zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), creating a hydrophobic barrier to prevent bacterial invasion. In vitro tests confirmed effective bacterial resistance, while hemostasis assays demonstrated enhanced platelet and red blood cell aggregation, accelerating coagulation. In vivo evaluations using rat liver injury and tail amputation models confirmed superior hemostatic performance, with blood loss reduced by 0.44 g and 0.23 g, respectively, and bleeding time shortened by 41.52 s and 59.47 s compared to Gauze. Furthermore, in full-thickness skin wound models, accelerated healing was achieved through infection prevention, increased collagen deposition (20.82 % higher than Control), and stimulated angiogenesis (3.10 % higher CD31 expression). These findings highlight CM@PS/TZ as a promising Janus dressing integrating antibacterial activity, hemostasis, and pro-angiogenic effects, offering an innovative solution for hemorrhagic wound treatment."

Alternative proteins, including plant-based, cultured meats, insects, algae, and microbial proteins, offer promising solutions; however, knowledge of their digestibility is limited, and the reported documents are often quite low. For instance, plant proteins contain anti-nutritional factors like phytic acid and trypsin inhibitors, which hinder absorption. Similarly, insects, algae, and microbial proteins have complex cellular structures or compounds that can interfere with protein breakdown and absorption. On the other hand, cultured meats may lack certain components critical for optimal digestion. Thus, novel and conventional processing methods are being studied to improve digestibility. In this context, continued research is essential to refine these techniques for different protein sources, ensuring a sustainable production of alternative proteins with high nutritional quality."

Quercetin increased protein digestion in the stomach and small intestine, while gallic and caffeic acids only increased its digestion in the stomach. Quercetin and caffeic promoted nearly iron release at all polyphenol-to-complex levels studied (0.5:1 to 3:1), whereas gallic acid only promoted iron release at higher ratios (3:1). Polyphenol retention after digestion was relatively low (1 %-7 %), except for caffeic acid (21.5 % at 3:1). A Caco-2 cell assay showed that ferritin production was enhanced at high gallic acid levels (3:1), and intermediate quercetin levels (1:1), but not under other conditions. These findings suggest that polyphenol-protein-iron interactions can be modulated to enhance iron bioavailability, which may be important for iron fortification strategies."

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) assessed depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression, Pearson correlation, and mediation analyses were conducted to evaluate odds ratios and associations between inflammatory indicators and depression.\n\nRESULTS: Correlation analysis revealed significant negative associations between four inflammatory indicators (CRP, C-reactive protein; PC, platelet count; SII, systemic immune-inflammation index; PPN, product of platelet count and neutrophil count) and HDL cholesterol, as well as between HDL cholesterol and depression, while the inflammatory indicators were significantly positively correlated with depression (all p < 0.05). Furthermore, multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for covariates, demonstrated that elevated levels of these four inflammatory indicators (CRP: adjusted OR = 1.011, CI = 1.003-1.025; PC: OR = 1.002, CI = 1.001-1.004; SII: OR = 1.002, CI = 1.001-1.003; PPN: OR = 1.002, CI = 1.001-1.004) were significantly associated with an increased risk of depression in the total study population. Finally, mediation analysis indicated that HDL cholesterol mediated the presumed causal associations between CRP (6.7-13.2 %), PC (4.5-12.8 %), PPN (4.8-14.9 %), and depression, whereas SII was identified as an independent predictor of depression development.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Targeting HDL cholesterol and inflammatory indicators such as CRP, PC, SII and PPN may provide potential interventions for mitigating depression risk."

The development of an analysis method for the sensitive monitoring of antifungal drugs is crucial, given their narrow therapeutic index. Traditional plasma sample processing involves several complex steps. Some of the processes are time-consuming, may result in the loss of trace components, and increase the difficulty of detection. To address these limitations, this work focused on developing a multi-component covalent organic framework (COF) coated solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber for efficient extraction and determination of triazole antifungal drugs in human plasma.\n\nRESULTS: The multi-component COF TAPT-DMTP-TFTA was synthesized using 4,4',4''-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)trianiline (TAPT), 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthaldehyde (TFTA), and 2,5-dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (DMTP), which exhibited high surface areas, considerable regular porosity and multiple recognition sites, rendering it an ideal adsorbent for the efficient enrichment of antifungal drugs. The COF-based SPME fiber was integrated with a high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) system for the effective extraction of antifungal drugs from human plasma. With optimized conditions, the method showed excellent linearity for voriconazole (VOR), posaconazole (POS) and isavuconazole (ISA) in the concentration range of 0.01-20 μg/mL, and for itraconazole (ICZ) within 0.05-20 μg/mL, achieving correlation coefficients (R\n\nSIGNIFICANCE AND NOVELTY: The newly synthesized multi-component COF exhibited high specific surface area, well-defined pores, and multiple recognition sites.

Their presence has been detected in human tissues, including blood and placental tissue, raising concerns about developmental effects. However, MPs' effects on the development of human organs are still mostly unknown. The kidney is essential to detoxification and waste excretion in the body and is highly sensitive to toxic substances, making it an important focus for research on toxicity. To study kidney development, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived kidney organoids offer a useful in vitro model. This research specifically examines the consequences of PS-MPs on the differentiation of hiPSCs into kidney organoids. Different concentrations of PS-MPs (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 μg/mL) were set according to the concentration of PS-MPs detected in blood at 1.6 μg/mL. The aim is to understand how environmental contaminants may impact kidney development at the cellular level. Our findings indicate that PS-MP exposure leads to nephron progenitor cell damage and disrupts key processes involved in kidney development, including nephron formation and epithelial cell differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PS-MPs induce mitochondrial oxidative stress, activate the Bcl-2 protein family, and trigger apoptosis via the Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-9/caspase-3 signaling pathway. This disruption ultimately impairs normal kidney organoid formation. These results underscore the detrimental impact of PS-MPs on embryonic kidney development and highlight the urgent need for further investigation into the health risks associated with microplastic exposure during early human development."

However, it remains unknown whether this posttranslational modification occurs on ciliary membrane proteins. Herein, by mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, we demonstrate that multiple membrane proteins localized in the ciliary transition zone undergo core fucosylation, an N-linked glycosylation specifically catalyzed by fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8). In-depth analysis reveals that FUT8 interacts with transmembrane protein 67 (TMEM67), a transition zone component closely linked to ciliopathies, and catalyzes its core fucosylation. Functional investigation shows that core fucosylation stabilizes TMEM67 by impeding its degradation via the autophagy pathway, thereby ensuring its proper localization to the transition zone to promote cilium formation. Fut8-deficient mice exhibit ciliary defects in multiple organs, such as the kidney, brain, and trachea. These findings uncover a critical role for TMEM67 core fucosylation in ciliogenesis and have important implications for the pathogenesis of ciliopathies."

Gremlin 1 (GREM1), a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist family, has emerged as a central regulator of cellular and extracellular dynamics, exhibiting dual roles in oncogenesis and fibrosis. By modulating BMP and TGF-β signaling pathways, GREM1 orchestrates critical pathogenic processes, including immune evasion, stromal dynamics, fibroblast activation, and angiogenesis. This review compiles current mechanistic insights into GREM1's dual roles in cancer and fibrosis, highlighting its potential as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target. GREM1 contributes to tumor progression by promoting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and therapy resistance while driving extracellular matrix deposition and tissue remodeling in fibrotic disorders. Emerging therapeutic strategies, including demethyleneberberine (DMB), anti-GREM1 antibodies, and circular RNAs, demonstrate potential in mitigating GREM1-driven pathological processes. GREM1's pivotal role in the pathophysiology of cancer and fibrosis highlights its promise as a target for innovative combination therapies and biomarker-based precision medicine approaches. However, translating these insights into clinical practice requires addressing challenges related to delivery specificity, off-target effects, and patient heterogeneity."

It exerts this effect by dephosphorylating the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS), attenuating insulin activity. It is a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily member, which includes a wide range of enzymes encoded by 107 distinct genes. The catalytic site of the PTP superfamily is positively charged and highly conserved among its members, which presents a significant challenge to developing inhibitors in terms of selectivity and oral bioavailability. T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP), which plays a crucial role in the proliferation of T-cells and B-cells, is a close homologue of PTP1B, sharing 74 % sequence similarity within the catalytic domain. Although considerable efforts have been made to develop a selective and potent PTP1B inhibitor, no molecule has yet been developed as a drug. However, a few candidate compounds reached phase II clinical trials, but their further study was discontinued due to suboptimal efficacy and the manifestation of undesirable side effects. In this review, we aimed to decipher the complications associated with the PTP1B enzyme and the design strategies used by various research groups to develop small-molecule inhibitors, emphasising the structure-activity relationship of small molecules synthesized for this target. This review also delineates the molecular features, which will aid in designing rational approaches and foster further research into this target of type 2 diabetes mellitus."

The paper discusses molecular representations, performance evaluation metrics, and current trends in Generative AI-driven drug discovery, such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs), drug-target interactions (DTIs) and de-novo drug design. However, these approaches face significant challenges, including applicability domain issues, lack of interpretability, data scarcity, novelty, scalability, computational resource limitations, and the absence of standardized evaluation metrics. These challenges hinder model performance, complicate decision-making, and limit the generation of novel and viable drug candidates. To address these issues, strategies such as hybrid models, integration of multiomics datasets, explainable AI (XAI) techniques, data augmentation, transfer learning, and cloud-based solutions are proposed.

In this paper, two sets of acylaminopyrazole-based compounds were designed to exploit the aminopyrazole core as a privileged structure properly decorated with an acyl moiety and a further amide function, connected with a proper spacer. Indeed, acylated aminopyrazoles could be able to establish the appropriate hydrogen bond pattern to both bind GSK-3β, responsible for tau hyperphosphorylation, prevent the formation of insoluble Aβ-protein aggregates and have the structural features to show chelating properties towards metals involved in neuroinflammation. The collection of compounds was tested in vitro for GSK-3β inhibition activity, antiaggregating and chelating properties. Selected compounds were able to inhibit GSK-3β in the low micromolar range with a reversible and competitive mechanism of action, as established by Microfluidic Mobility Shift Assay (MMSA) and showed metal chelating ability. Preliminary Structure Activity Relationships (SARs) to hit these distinct and interconnected targets for neuromodulation were established. Finally, selected compounds showed good apparent permeability values in parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) together with good cellular safety profile. The collected results validated acylaminopyrazole as promising scaffold for the development of multitarget-directed ligands.

Due to its smaller molecular size, catechin more easily penetrated the hydrophobic cores of proteins, yielding higher binding stoichiometry and concentration-dependent aggregation. At 4 mM, extensive aggregation masked proteolytic cleavage sites, reducing gastrointestinal digestibility by 7.3 % for 7S and 15.1 % for 11S. In contrast, EGCG, with an additional galloyl moiety and a denser hydroxyl network, interacted with proteins through synergistic hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic forces. It produced more stable supramolecular complexes with much larger diameters (462.2 ± 6.8 nm for 11S-EGCG, versus 30.3 ± 1.5 nm for native 11S), and lowered IgE-binding capacity by approximately 19.5-38.7 %, probably through epitope masking and surface-charge changes. For both polyphenols, binding significantly decreased solvent accessibility of hydrophobic regions, reorganized secondary structure (α-helix loss and β-sheet gain), and markedly enhanced intrinsic antioxidant capacity. These findings demonstrate that selecting an appropriate polyphenol type and dose can simultaneously confer hypoallergenic potential, controlled digestibility, and elevated antioxidant function.

With aging, the immune system weakens, and the body becomes more vulnerable to infections and inflammation. Moreover, conditions such as sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and non-communicable chronic diseases (hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity) are more common among older adults. However, diet can play a fundamental role in maintaining health and preventing various pathologies. Fermented dairy products, which are rich in high-quality proteins and bioactive peptides, can serve as valuable allies in healthy aging. These peptides, released during fermentation, ripening, or digestion, exhibit several beneficial activities, including antihypertensive, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and antidiabetic effects, with the potential to improve the quality of life in older adults. This review aims to present the benefits of consuming fermented dairy products for the health of older adults, highlighting how the bioactive peptides present in these foods may aid control health conditions associated with aging. By exploring the processes of fermentation and digestion, and the mechanisms involved in the release of these peptides, the review provides a detailed overview of the potential benefits of consuming fermented dairy products in promoting health and preventing diseases in older adults."

However, the bioavailability of its conjugated linolenic acids, an essential factor for assessing their impact on health, remains poorly understood. This study used the harmonized in vitro protocol INFOGEST to investigate the bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil in comparison to olive oil. Bioaccessibility, key aspect of bioavailability, refers to the proportion of a nutrient released in the gastrointestinal tract and available for intestinal absorption. It was determined by measuring the ratio of fatty acids present in the absorbable fraction (monoglycerides and free fatty acids) to total fatty acids quantified by gas chromatography following solid-phase extraction. Results showed that the overall bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil was equivalent to that of olive oil. Notably, punicic acid (in pomegranate seed oil) and oleic acid (in olive oil) - both 18‑carbon fatty acids present in equivalent quantities in the two oils, showed high and equivalent bioaccessibility. The presence of proteins (whey and soy protein isolates) did not affect the bioaccessibility of the major fatty acids under experimental conditions. The recovery index was high for all fatty acids, indicating minor degradation during in vitro digestion, and was not affected by the presence of oxygen. In conclusion, punicic acid is efficiently released by digestive lipases, suggesting good bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil. This finding paves the way for its potential application in oral therapeutic use."

RNA-Seq analysis of colon tissues and UPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS phytochemical profiling were integrated with functional validation using erastin-induced ferroptosis in Caco-2 cells. Virtual docking, molecular interactions, and gene-editing were employed for mechanistic investigation.\n\nRESULTS: PHE administration significantly attenuated DSS-induced weight loss and disease activity index elevation, while preserving intestinal mucosal integrity. Transcriptomic analysis and in vivo experiments revealed PHE's regulation of glutathione metabolic pathways and ferroptosis. The flavonoids in PHE, especially aromadendrin, were identified as the primary active component binding to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1(KEAP1)'s Kelch domain, thereby activating Nrf2 signaling and upregulating glutathione (GSH) synthesis genes. Nrf2 ablation or KEAP1 over-expression abolished PHE's protective effects, confirming pathway specificity.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our findings establish that PHE exerts anti-colitis effects through KEAP1/Nrf2/GSH axis-mediated ferroptosis inhibition, with aromadendrin serving as the key bioactive compound. This mechanistic elucidation provides translational rationale for developing PHE-based therapies for ulcerative colitis."

Each segment of the SpA operon, from the 5' promoter region and signal peptide to the 3' cell wall anchoring region, has been exploited for various innovative applications in areas such as immunology and biotechnology. We provide an overview of selected applications and concepts that have had a significant impact on life science research, and some that have also led to significant commercial implications. In the 1980s, the SpA promoter and signal sequence were utilized in Escherichia coli for recombinant production of various proteins, yielding product secretion to the culture medium and thereby simplifying product recovery. The five homologous Ig-binding domains of SpA gained tremendous interest in the late 1980s, largely due to the rise of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for therapeutic use, prompting a growing demand for effective affinity ligands to facilitate their purification. Over the years, these Ig-binding domains have been extensively investigated and re-engineered to bind proteins other than antibodies, leading in the mid-1990s to the development of the affibody affinity protein technology. Today, affibody molecules are being investigated in late-stage clinical trials as potential protein therapeutics for various indications. Finally, the cell wall anchoring regions of SpA inspired the development of a surface display system for Staphylococcus carnosus, which has emerged as a technology platform in combinatorial protein engineering for work with large peptide, antibody and affibody libraries."

However, targeted metabolomics studies of serum amino acids in silicosis patients remain limited. Herein, we developed a specific serum amino acid metabolomics assay for identifying differential amino acids as biomarkers, providing a sensitive and reliable basis for diagnosing silicosis. A hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of 21 amino acids in serum was established by optimizing chromatographic and sample preparation conditions. The method validation results showed good linearity (r > 0.99), recovery (78.3 %-128.4 %) and precision (1.27 %-13.01 %). The developed method was utilized to detect the levels of 21 amino acids in the serum of the silicosis patient group (SP; n = 104) and the healthy control group (HC; n = 118). The concentration of four amino acids (glutamate, arginine, aspartic acid and ornithine) was significantly different between the SP and the HC. Single diagnostic biomarkers exhibited area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.712 to 0.892, while the glutamate-arginine combination achieved superior performance (AUC = 0.915, 86.1 % sensitivity, 90.0 % specificity). The aforementioned results indicate that four biomarkers were screened for the diagnosis of silicosis, with glutamate emerging as the most accurate single biomarker for predicting silicosis. The diagnostic performance was further enhanced by combining glutamate with arginine, which improved both sensitivity and specificity."

While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the \"black box\" nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding."

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), commonly found in fermented foods, have taken on a dual role-as both passive encapsulation targets and active delivery carriers-forming a conceptual basis for the development of next-generation food delivery systems. This review examines the interactions between LAB and various food-grade encapsulation materials including proteins (such as whey protein, casein, zein), polysaccharides (like alginate, chitosan), and lipids (such as liposomes, W/O/W emulsions), highlighting roles of electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, covalent cross-linking, and interfacial self-assembly. Moreover, four emerging LAB-based delivery systems are classified: (i) surface adsorption via non-covalent interactions, (ii) intracellular loading driven by membrane transport or biosynthesis, (iii) co-encapsulation in hydrogels and emulsions, as well as (iv) engineered LAB capable of in situ synthesis and targeted release. The review also summarizes practical applications in hydrocolloid-rich food systems, such as yogurt, plant-based gels, and functional beverages. These applications highlight LAB's contribution to enhancing structural stability, controlled release, and nutritional functionality. Finally, key challenges are discussed, including the limited compatibility between encapsulating materials and food matrices, insufficient understanding of the interactions between exopolysaccharides and interfaces, and the need for in vivo validation. Based on these insights, future directions are proposed to guide the rational design of next-generation LAB-based delivery systems for precision nutrition and functional food innovation."

This study focuses on NLRP3 expressed in circulatory immune cells, to elucidate the systemic level significance of NLRP3 inflammasome in contributing to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression. We therefore, aim to investigate the mRNA expression signature of genes encoding the NLRP3 inflammasome complex in circulatory immune cells and its association with severity of DKD in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.\n\nMATERIALS & METHODS: PBMCs were isolated from the blood samples of 160 T2DM patients presenting with varying grades of DKD severity. RNA extracted from the PBMCs was used for relative quantification of our target genes using SYBRGreen real-time RT-qPCR. Association of DKD progression with NLRP3 component genes' mRNA expression was analyzed statistically.\n\nRESULTS: Expression of NLRP3, CASP1, and IL1β mRNAs were significantly elevated in DKD; higher HSP72 mRNA expression accompanied normoalbuminuric T2DM. PBMC-derived NLRP3 mRNA levels correlated positively with circulatory monocyte population. Plasma NLRP3 protein and NLRP3 mRNA expressed in PBMCs were associated inversely with decreasing eGFR, independent of diabetes duration, age and sex. Contrastingly, HSP72 mRNA levels declined with decline in eGFR. No association between NLRP3 complex genes and HSP72 mRNA expression in PBMCs was observed, although HSP72 exhibited inverse characteristics to that of NLRP3 complex in the study.\n\nCONCLUSION: A dynamic interplay exists between DKD progression and PBMC-derived mRNA expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and HSP72. At the systemic level, while NLRP3 exasperates inflammation, the protective role of HSP72 is extinguished. Their expression patterns in circulatory immune cells are associated with eGFR decline, tying systemic inflammatory state to worsening kidney disease outcomes."

Serum adipokines, cytokines, complement proteins, C- reactive protein, Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) profile, anti-dsDNA antibodies and anti-phospholipid antibody (APA) profile were estimated using immunoassay.

Serum IL-1β, INFγ, IL-6 and MCP-1 levels were significantly elevated whereas IL-4 levels were prominently reduced in LN patients when compared with healthy controls (p < 0.05). Serum C1q and CFP levels were significantly reduced in LN patients (p < 0.05). Elevated pentraxin-3 levels directly correlated with long disease duration and high SLEDAI score (p < 0.05). Declining renal function parameters strongly correlated with raised adiponectin, adipsin and resistin levels (p < 0.05). Adipsin levels positively correlated with complement components C3, C4 and CFB levels (p < 0.05). The PCA of serum proteins in LN patients identified three distinct clusters comprising of 37 (Cluster1), 24 (Cluster2) and 1 (Cluster3) patients in each. Adiponectin, resistin and CRP levels were found to be elevated in patients belonging to Cluster1. On the contrary, MCP1 levels were raised in Cluster2 LN patients.\n\nCONCLUSION: The association of raised resistin, adipsin, pentraxin-3 levels with deteriorating renal function is suggestive of their potential role in LN pathogenesis. The association between adipokines and complement components indicates the regulatory role of adipokines on complements and vice versa. The identification of patient clusters based on serum protein profile indicated involvement of unique biological profiles in diverse LN pathogenesis mechanism."

    "text": "RNA aptamers are emerging as promising molecular probes due to their high specificity and low immunogenicity. However, their clinical potential is often limited by instability under physiological conditions, primarily due to exonucleolytic degradation and structural flexibility. To address these challenges in a model system, we designed a circular RNA aptamer targeting the HIV-1 Tat protein. Enzymatic circularization of the aptamer was performed using T4 RNA ligase, and circularization was confirmed by mobility shift assays and RNase R digestion. Binding affinity was assessed via filter dot blot assay, while structural stability was evaluated using 1D imino proton NMR and CLEANEX-PM experiments. Intracellular stability was monitored using in-cell NMR following transfection into HeLa cells. In our study, the circular aptamer showed approximately tenfold higher binding affinity compared to its linear counterpart, as determined by filter binding assay. NMR analysis indicated improved structural rigidity, preservation of native base pairing, and reduced solvent exchange. Notably, in-cell NMR revealed that the circular aptamer remained detectable up to 18 h post-transfection, whereas the linear aptamer degraded within a few hours. In this system, circularization substantially improved the binding performance and intracellular persistence of the RNA aptamer. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of applying RNA circularization to enhance aptamer functionality in living cells and lay the groundwork for future therapeutic exploration."

At 96 h, biofilm matrix components (exoproteins, eDNA, and carbohydrates) and microbial viability (confocal microscopy and PMA-qPCR) were quantified. Relative gene expression analysis was also conducted with species-specific genes (gtfB, sagP, arcA, argG, argH).\n\nRESULTS: For carbohydrates, no significant difference was identified among treatment groups (p>0.05). Protein content for 0.5 % Arg+LRG was significantly lower than LRG (p<0.05). The lowest eDNA content was observed in LRG (p<0.05); while eDNA content of 0.5 % Arg+LRG, was similar to 0.5 % Arg and control (p>0.05). Using confocal imaging, the highest proportion of live cell was found in 0.5 % Arg+LRG (p<0.05), followed by 0.25 % Arg+LRG, 3-D biofilm imaging demonstrated increased biomass with smoother architecture in biofilms treated with 0.5 % Arg+LRG (p<0.05). 0.5 % Arg+LRG significantly enhanced growth of commensal streptococci (S. gordonii, S. sanguinis) compared to monotherapies and control, while also reducing viability of S. mutans compared to control (p<0.05). Gene expression analysis revealed downregulation of S. mutans virulence (gtfB) and upregulation of commensal metabolism (sagP, arcA) for 0.5 % Arg+LRG (p<0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION: The 0.5 % Arg+LRG synbiotics uniquely integrates ecological modulation by regulating biochemical matrix components, promoting commensal enrichment and suppressing cariogenic pathogens.\n\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: A deliverable Arg-LRG synbiotics for caries prevention addresses a global public health priority. This strategy aligns with microbial homeostasis principles, presenting a novel paradigm for caries prevention. The Arg-LRG synbiotics can counter the limitations of fluorides to establish a diverse oral microbiome, imparting an ecologically driven approach to caries prevention."

This study aimed to search drug-like compounds for possible inhibitors of the NS5 protein of dengue virus (serotype 2). In the present study, a data set of twenty-five Beta vulgaris. L-based phytoconstituents was developed. We employed machine learning (ML) data pre-processing, screening of differentially expressed transcripts and genes, identification of common transcriptional signatures and pathways and function enrichment analysis of dengue infection; and protein-protein interaction network construction and identification of hub genes. ML data revealed that NS5 mRNA was downregulated by betanin, kaempferol, quercetin hydrate, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside. Moreover, administering these compounds can alleviate host innate immune factor suppression mediated by NS5, thereby exhibiting antiviral activity. Molecular docking and pharmacokinetics studies revealed a potential therapeutic role of betanin, kaempferol, quercetin hydrate, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside phytoconstituents as potent antiviral phytocompounds. MD simulation and post-simulation analysis, including principal component analysis and dynamic cross-correlation, confirmed the antiviral therapeutic potency of betanin, kaempferol, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside against dengue virus infection. In vitro cytotoxic studies also depicted nontoxic effects of betanin and quercetin hydrate in Vero and CHO cells at a concentration range of 20-0.31 μM. In summary, computational screening and in vitro cytotoxicity analysis revealed that betanin, kaempferol, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside may prove as potential drug candidates against dengue virus regarding their possible safety and antiviral activity in future."

Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) is a vital tool for identifying druggable targets in skeletal muscle to develop T2DM treatments.\n\nMETHODS: Potential causative genetic factors in skeletal muscle and blood causally associated with T2DM were identified by SMR analysis. Bayesian colocalisation were used to validate causality. Pleiotropic impact of drug targets was assessed using phenome-wide MR (Phe-MR). Then, targeted overexpression or knockdown of AEBP1 in mouse myoblast cell lines (C2C12) and human skeletal muscle cells (HSkMCs) further validated the functional phenotype. Protein docking, co-IP and SPR were used to demonstrate protein-protein interactions.\n\nRESULTS: Both European and Asian populations revealed that AEBP1 was significantly associated with T2DM and its glycemic profile in blood and skeletal muscle, and was identified as a risk factor. Co-localisation analyses suggest that AEBP1 and T2DM originate from the same genetic variants. Meanwhile, targeted AEBP1 therapy has no potential adverse effects. Furthermore, AEBP1 was significantly expressed in in vivo and in vitro IR models and was consistent with the SMR results. Overexpression of AEBP1 further impaired insulin signalling and glucose transport mechanisms, exacerbating skeletal muscle IR. Targeting AEBP1 knockdown reversed these changes. Protein interaction experiments revealed that PI3K (p110β) is a direct target protein for AEBP1 to exert molecular functions.\n\nCONCLUSION: Targeting AEBP1 therapy is expected to be a pivotal approach for the prevention and treatment of T2DM."

(Xuta) is a new crop whose seed kernels are rich in high-quality proteins and fat; however, they contain antinutrients such as trypsin inhibitors, phytic acid and lectins. Hydrothermal treatment has been shown to significantly reduce these antinutritional factors, leading to the recent approval of Xuta kernels for human consumption by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Despite this, current scientific information is limited, for example, data on the potential genotoxicity of Xuta kernels. In this study, aqueous extracts from three Xuta cultivars were assessed for mutagenicity using the bacterial reverse mutation assay and genotoxicity using the Comet assay with human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Additionally, key antinutritional factors such as lectin activity, trypsin inhibitor activity, and phytic acid content were determined. Hydrothermal treatment significantly reduced antinutritional factors, with lectin activity being completely absent. The results show that the Xuta cultivars tested have no mutagenic or genotoxic potential and are suitable for human consumption after hydrothermal treatment. These findings support the introduction of Xuta kernels as an alternative protein source. Future research should focus on technofunctional properties and applications of Xuta proteins."

This study investigated the roles of phenylalanine (Phe) and cholesterol metabolism in BLCA chemoresistance using integrated omics and computational modeling. Transcriptomic analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets revealed that elevated hexokinase 2 (HK2) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expression correlates with poor response to cisplatin. Mechanistically, Phe catabolism via phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activated mTORC1 signaling, promoting glycolysis and drug efflux, while cholesterol biosynthesis driven by SREBP2 enhanced ABCG2 transporter activity. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses confirmed causal associations between Phe/cholesterol metabolism and chemoresistance risk. Pharmacological inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase or dietary phenylalanine restriction sensitized BLCA cells to cisplatin both in vitro and in xenograft models. Overexpression of FOLH1 or F7 reversed the inhibitory effects of Phe or cholesterol targeting, respectively, confirming their functional roles in resistance. These findings identify FOLH1 and F7 as mediators of metabolic resistance in BLCA and suggest metabolic targeting as a promising therapeutic strategy. However, whether combined inhibition of Phe and cholesterol pathways provides synergistic benefits over monotherapy remains to be determined in future studies."

This study prepared carboxymethyl starch (CMS)-whey protein isolate (WPI) crosslinked complexes (CMS-WPI/TA) by regulating the interaction in the CMS-WPI system by tannin (TA), and explored the effects of the complexes on the secretion of satiety hormones. The results showed that after the addition of TA, the interaction in CMS-WPI system shifted from electrostatic interactions to hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, forming more compact, uniform, and ordered TA-crosslinked complexes. In vitro simulated digestion results indicated that the digestion rates of CMS and WPI in CMS-WPI/TA2 in the upper gastrointestinal tract were reduced to 5.77 % and 26.33 %, respectively, thus permitting most of the CMS and WPI to reach the colon and be degraded by the gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids, peptides, and amino acids. These metabolic products can stimulate the sustained secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) by L cells, with their secretion increased by 101.02 % and 106.30 % compared to the blank group, respectively. The TA-crosslinked complexes also increased the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria such as Dialister and Blautia, and reduced the abundance of harmful gut microbiota such as Collinsella. The results of this study provide new insights into regulating starch-protein interactions to improve their resistance to digestion and contribute to the development of functional foods that are beneficial to the human gut microbiota and enhance satiety."

This study investigated the changes in gel properties, endogenous enzyme activities, flavor characteristics and metabolic profile during mechanical pre-dehydration of minced fish, compared to the traditional washing process, in order to understand the relationship between changes in endogenous components and processing quality. The results showed that the pre-dehydration process preserved some of the TGase activities (65.96 U/mg) but also some of the proteases and some metabolites (e.g. Histamine and Phosphatidylcholine) that are detrimental to the gelling process, and the gel strength of the obtained surimi gels was lower but acceptable than that of the washed surimi gels (390.97 g·cm and 464.51 g·cm). The gel strength of unwashed surimi was unacceptable (284.03 g·cm). Pre-dehydrated surimi preserved higher levels of amino acids, glycerolipids, and glycerophospholipids than washed surimi, leading to enhanced flavor precursor retention and generation of volatile compounds during gelling. Compared to washed surimi gel, pre-dehydrated surimi gels exhibited stronger warm-over and fishy flavor (Heptanal, Octanal, et al), while retaining more desirable aromas (3-Hexanone, 1-hexanol, et al).

FA primer was prepared by mixing ethyl acetate and ethanol as a binary solvent system at solvent ratios of 7:3, 6:4, 5:5, and 4:6. The optimal ratio of ethyl acetate to ethanol was determined by measuring the degree of conversion (DC) and contact angle, combining the microtensile bond strength (µTBS) and fracture pattern immediately and 10,000 thermocycles. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activities and adhesive infiltration at the interface were observed, whereas scanning electron microscopy was used to further evaluate nanoleakage and resin rags.\n\nRESULTS: Application of the primer containing a mixed EAC:ET-4:6 solvent resulted in a significant enhancement in the µTBS of both immediate and aging groups, and the contact angle of the demineralized dentin surface. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were further observed the infiltration properties of resin rags in the bonding interface were strengthened. The MMPs activities in the hybrid layer was clearly inhibited, and the degree of nanoleakage at the bonding interface reduced remarkably, thus, it improved the stability and durability of the bond.\n\nCONCLUSION: FA primers containing appropriate ratios of ethanol and ethyl acetate solvents can simplify operation procedures, enhances collagen fiber resistance to enzymatic degradation, and improves hybrid layer sealing, thereby increasing bonding strength.\n\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The FA primer formulated with an ethyl acetate-ethanol mixed solvent aim to achieve high-strength, low leakage, and long-term durable adhesive effects, demonstrating dual functional advantages: Effective collagen crosslinking capacity leading to enhanced bond durability and reduced secondary caries incidence, alongside decreased technique sensitivity. These findings provide novel perspectives for FA primer applications in clinical practice."

    "text": "Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite generated through the cooperation of gut microbiota and liver, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that TMAO promotes lipid deposition in both in vivo and in vitro models. In high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, the conversion of TMA to TMAO was increased, and supplementation with TMAO exacerbated lipid accumulation and liver dysfunction. In contrast, flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3)-Sh alleviated hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis identified heat shock protein 90β (HSP90β) as a potential downstream effector of TMAO. In both HepG2 cells and HFD-fed mice, TMAO upregulated HSP90β expression, perturbing protein homeostasis. FMO3 Sh reduced HSP90β protein activity and mRNA levels. Meanwhile, proteomic analysis revealed that the TMAO/HSP90β axis disrupts mitochondrial protein homeostasis, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by MPTP opening, MMP decrease, and ROS production. In vivo, activation of the FMO3/TMAO/HSP90β axis aggravated mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by swollen mitochondria with reduced cristae observed via TEM. Notably, FMO3 Sh ameliorated mitochondrial function by suppressing the TMAO/HSP90β axis. In summary, our study demonstrates that the FMO3/TMAO/HSP90β axis promotes MAFLD progression by targeting mitochondrial protein homeostasis and influencing lipid metabolism."

However, the administration of Fulvestrant via the intramuscular route has imposed significant limitations on its clinical application, prompting the exploration of active oral bioavailable SERDs. Furthermore, research institutes and pharmaceutical companies have evaluated the efficacy of various oral SERDs in terms of their ability to degrade the ER, binding capacity, safety profiles, and numerous other indicators.

DKD patients exhibit elevated lactate concentrations due to impaired glucose metabolism. Lactate serves as a substrate for a post-translational modification known as lactylation, which is integral to numerous cellular processes. The study aimed to explore the potential role of lactylation in DKD podocyte injury and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. The results showed that lactate concentrations were elevated in the plasma of DKD patients, as well as in the serum and renal tissue of diabetic mice. High glucose (HG) resulted in increased lactate accumulation in podocytes, exacerbated podocyte injury and promoted protein lactylation. Protein modification omics demonstrated that LARS1 lactylation was enhanced, specifically at the K970 site, which further aggravated podocyte injury by inhibiting autophagy and promoting apoptosis. In vivo transfection with LARS1 siRNA significantly improved renal function and mitigated podocyte injury. Our study identified a novel mechanism linking LARS1 lactylation activity to compromised podocyte autophagy, heightened podocyte injury, and the onset of proteinuria within DKD."

Although ketogenic diet (KD) has gained attention for its potential therapeutic effects in cancer, the relationship between KD, cancer biology, and metabolic signaling remains underexplored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of KD on lung cancer biology using an in vivo model developed with AAV and CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in mice fed either a KD or high-carbohydrate diet (HCD). RNA-seq analysis revealed that KD markedly upregulated expression of Cytochrome P450 Family 1 Subfamily A Member 1 (CYP1A1) in lung cancer tissues compared to HCD. Protein analysis confirmed increased CYP1A1 levels under KD independently of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) protein levels. Similarly, in A549 and H460 human lung cancer cells treated with β-hydroxybutyrate and low-glucose conditions mimicking KD, CYP1A1 expression was also elevated. Interestingly, we observed that CYP1A1 expression is dependent on AhR activity and nuclear translocation in A549 cells in vitro. Transcriptome analysis of CYP1A1 knockdown A549 cells indicated that CYP1A1 is crucial for regulating cell cycle genes, including cyclin D. These findings highlight the biological significance of CYP1A1 in KD-induced changes in lung cancer, suggesting its role in cell proliferation and tumor development. This study also provides insights into the metabolic signaling underlying the effects of KD on cancer, offering potential directions for future therapeutic strategies."

Glioma pathogenesis-related protein 2(GLIPR2) has been reported to be associated with EndoMT, but whether it can regulate cardiac fibrosis is unknown. This study aimed to explore the contribution of GLIPR2 to post-AMI fibrosis and its underlying mechanism.\n\nMETHODS: Serum protein levels of GLIPR2 were measured in patients with AMI. LAD ligation surgery was used to establish AMI animal models in C57BL/6 J mice. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-targeted knockdown of GLIPR2 was employed to investigate the effects of GLIPR2 on cardiac fibrosis, cardiac pumping function, and EndoMT after AMI in mice. In human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs), GLIPR2 overexpression and knockdown via lentivirus (LV) were utilized to examine angiogenesis, migration, proliferation, and EndoMT under hypoxic conditions.\n\nRESULTS: In the serum of AMI patients, GLIPR2 expression was significantly increased. In mice with AMI, GLIPR2 knockdown reversed EndoMT, attenuated heart fibrosis, and partially restored ventricular pumping function. In a hypoxic cell model, GLIPR2 overexpression enhanced cell proliferation, migration, neovascularization, and EndoMT, whereas GLIPR2 knockdown inhibited these processes. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing and recovery studies identified the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-like protein (PDGFRL)/AKT/mTOR pathway as a critical regulator of GLIPR2-mediated EndoMT.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: GLIPR2 promotes cardiac fibrosis repair by regulating EndoMT through the PDGFRL/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Its inhibition represents a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate cardiac fibrosis and improve ventricular function following AMI."

    "text": "The cost of cancer care globally is unsustainable and strategies to reduce the mounting burden of cancer are urgently needed. One approach is the use of preventive therapies to reduce cancer risk; dietary-derived compounds with good safety profiles represent a promising source of potential candidates but translating encouraging preclinical data to successful trials presents significant challenges. Development of curcumin, from the spice turmeric, as a preventive therapy for colorectal cancer (CRC) is hindered by poor understanding of its mechanism of action. Using patient derived xenografts and ex-vivo 3D-models exposed to clinically achievable curcumin concentrations, we found that it targets proliferating cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) within premalignant adenoma and early-stage cancer tissues, with broad spectrum activity across all molecular subtypes. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that curcumin pushes CSCs towards differentiation over self-renewal, thereby inhibiting tumour development. Evidence suggests these effects involve direct protein binding of curcumin to NANOG, a master regulator of CRC CSCs, and impairment of its transcriptional activity via direct interference with NANOG-DNA binding. Furthermore, curcumin decreased the proportion of proliferating CSCs, defined by NANOG/Ki67 co-expression in patient derived explants and individuals with tumours containing a small fraction of these cells had greatly improved progression-free survival compared to those in the highest quartile for expression. The use of curcumin to minimise this cellular population may yield significant benefit and its clinical evaluation is warranted. Overall, this study provides crucial mechanistic insight, identifying patient populations likely to benefit from curcumin for prevention of sporadic CRC and theragnostic biomarkers for assessing efficacy."

This study aims to investigate whether the administration of IL-10 can suppress disease flares in ulcerative colitis (UC).\n\nMETHODS: A UC model was established in mice using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to evaluate the therapeutic effect of IL-10. LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells were utilized to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, focusing on apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress.\n\nRESULTS: IL-10 administration significantly alleviated clinical symptoms in DSS-induced colitis, including promoting body weight recovery, increasing colon length, and reducing disease activity index scores. IL-10 repaired the intestinal mucosal barrier by inhibiting apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, Interferon-γ, and IL-1β), and modulating oxidative stress markers, such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). In LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells, IL-10 protected against apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Bioinformatics analysis of control and IL-10 knockout mice showed a significant upregulation of Interferon-Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15) after IL-10 knockout. In contrast, ISG15 expression was downregulated in the LPS + IL-10 group but upregulated in LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells. These results suggest that ISG15 is a target gene of IL-10 and plays a role in autophagy regulation. Furthermore, IL-10 enhanced autophagy by increasing the protein expression of ATG7, and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, thereby reducing apoptosis and oxidative stress in Caco-2 cells. Autophagy inhibition with 3-Methyladenine or overexpression of ISG15 diminished IL-10's protective effects.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that IL-10 administration inhibits the progression of UC by activating autophagy and modulating ISG15 expression. In the future, targeted delivery of IL-10 to the intestinal lamina propria may enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects."

The objective of this study was to assess the anti-wrinkle and anti-aging effects of Arazyme in skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts subjected to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation and oxidative stress. Keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) and fibroblasts (CCD-986sk) were exposed to UVB (15 mJ/cm²) radiation or oxidative stress induced by 2 mM 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), followed by treatment with Arazyme (0.1-0.5 μM) for 24 h. The effects of Arazyme were compared to those of individual treatments with papain, trypsin, or retinol, which served as reference compounds. Key parameters examined included the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13), collagen synthesis, and cellular senescence markers (LMNB1, p16, p21, and p53). Additionally, the impact of Arazyme on cellular signaling pathways, including ERK, JNK, and NF-κB, was assessed. Arazyme significantly suppressed UVB-induced expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 in a dose-dependent manner in HaCaT cells compared to other treatments. In UVB-exposed fibroblasts, Arazyme reduced both mRNA and protein levels of MMPs, while also enhancing procollagen concentration and collagen gene expression. Furthermore, Arazyme inhibited the activation of ERK, JNK, and NF-κB signaling pathways in keratinocytes. In AAPH-stimulated HaCaT cells, Arazyme significantly attenuated the expression of senescence-related markers, including LMNB1, p16, p21, and p53, and decreased the proportion of senescence-positive cells in fibroblasts. Our in vitro findings suggest that Arazyme may help attenuate UVB- and oxidative stress-induced markers of skin aging, indicating its potential as a candidate for further investigation in anti-aging skincare research."

The aim of this study was to assess the protective effect of Qiukui Taoren Recipe (QT), and the potential molecular mechanisms in AKI using network pharmacology prediction, in vivo and in vitro experiment. There were 42 active components of QT detected by HPLC-Q-TOF/MS, and network pharmacology showed that these active components mainly could act with 63 core targets such as TNF-α, Caspase-3, BCL2, STAT3, PPARγ, and regulated 110 signaling pathways for alleviating AKI. In addition, QT reduced periocular oedema, renal malformations and size reduction, partially restore renal excretory function, and reduced the accumulation of proteinuria in zebrafish AKI model induced by caristolochic acid (AA). QT could upregulate the mRNA expression of Nephrin and oxidative stress genes (Nrf2, HO-1, PPARγ), and downregulate inflammation- and apoptosis-related genes (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, NF-κB, Caspase-3, P53). Furthermore, QT inhibited ROS elevation and apoptosis activated by cisplatin (CDDP) in HEK293T cells. Western blotting results showed that QT could enhance the protein expression of nephrin, and inhibited the protein expression of Kim-1, IL-18, NLRP3, STAT3, P53 and Caspase-3.

Although lactylation has garnered increasing attention, its role in TAD remains poorly understood.\n\nMETHODS: Lactylation-related genes (LRGs) were obtained from the MsigDB database. Lactylation-related hub genes (LRHGs) were identified by intersecting LRGs with differentially expressed genes and WGCNA results. Lactylation was assessed in a β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN)-induced mouse model and human aortic tissues. Two single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from the GEO database were utilized to evaluate lactylation patterns across cell populations and intercellular communication networks. Biomarkers were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Elevated lactylation levels were observed in both TAD tissues and synthetic phenotype vascular smooth muscle cells. Through integrated analysis, we identified 12 LRHGs, which includes LDHA. In the BAPN-induced mouse model, LDHA inhibitors (Oxamate and FX11) significantly reduced mortality rates and decreased aortic lactate levels and protein lactylation. ScRNA-seq analytic results revealed that monocytes and macrophages exhibited the highest lactylation activity, which likely enhanced their inflammatory pathways and intercellular communication. ROC analysis showed the lowest AUC of 12 LRHGs is 0.8893.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the critical role of lactylation-related hub genes in TAD, identifying potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers, which provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying TAD."

The neural and behavioral mechanisms for such primate-typical food preferences remain poorly understood, despite their importance for human health and their targeting by pharmacological obesity treatments. Here, we review a series of experiments that investigated how the biologically critical properties of foods-their nutrients (sugar, fat, protein) and oral-sensory qualities (viscosity, oral sliding friction)-influence food preferences in monkeys and humans. In an economic nutrient-choice paradigm, macaques flexibly trade nutrients and oral-sensory food qualities against varying food amounts, consistent with the assignment of subjective values. Nutrient-value functions that link objective nutrient content to subjective values accurately model these preferences, predict choices across contexts, and explain individual differences. The monkeys' aggregated choice patterns resulting from their nutrient preferences lead to daily nutrient balances that deviate from dietary reference points, resembling suboptimal human eating patterns when exposed to high-calorie foods. To investigate the sensory basis underlying nutrient values, we developed novel engineering tools that quantify food textures on oral surfaces, using fresh pig tongues. Oral-texture (i.e., mouthfeel) parameters, including viscosity and sliding friction, were shown to mediate monkeys' preferences for high-fat foods. When translated to human subjects, this approach revealed a neural mechanism for preferring high-fat foods from oral texture in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-a key reward system of the brain. Importantly, human OFC responses to oral sliding friction in individual subjects-measured in the MRI scanner-predicted subsequent fat intake in a naturalistic, life-like eating test. These findings suggest that a primate nutrient-reward paradigm offers a promising approach for investigating the behavioral and neural mechanisms for human-typical food reward and food choice, to advance understanding of human eating behavior, overeating, and obesity."

Developing of sensitive and specific diagnostic assays is crucial for effective HVL control in Brazil, enabling early disease detection and improving treatment outcomes. To enhance diagnostic capabilities, we evaluated the performance of a chimeric protein designed from B-lymphocyte cell epitopes identified through immunoproteomic analysis in serological tests for detecting L. infantum infection. Under the experimental conditions, the chimeric protein demonstrated the following diagnostic performance: 100 % specificity against control samples, 94.12 % specificity against Chagas disease samples, and 100 % sensitivity for HVL-positive individuals. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated the following performance metrics: area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9960, 100 % sensitivity, and 97.10 % overall specificity, significantly exceeding the performance of the L. infantum soluble antigen (SLiA) ELISA.

The review focuses on diverse HDT mechanisms utilizing their modulators like small molecule, protein-based, lipid-based, vitamin-based, and polysaccharide-based therapeutics. Key mechanisms include autophagy induction through multiple pathways, including mTOR inhibition, calcium signaling modulation, and TFEB activation. Notable compounds such as dimethyl itaconate, tamoxifen, and berbamine demonstrate significant efficacy in enhancing autophagosome formation and bacterial clearance. Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors like doxycycline show promise in reducing tissue damage and cavity formation. The review highlights the importance of metabolic modulation through compounds like metformin and ezetimibe, which target cellular energy pathways and cholesterol metabolism respectively. Immunomodulatory approaches, including phosphodiesterase inhibition and cytokine regulation, demonstrate potential in optimizing host immune responses. Novel mechanisms such as ferroptosis inhibition and pyroptosis modulation present promising therapeutic avenues. The review also examines the role of established drugs being repurposed for TB treatment, including statins and antidepressants. While preclinical evidence supports the efficacy of various HDTs, the review emphasizes the need for careful consideration of host-pathogen interactions and potential immunological approaches. The complexity of TB pathophysiology necessitates a personalized approach to HDT implementation. Future research directions should focus on clinical validation, optimal dosing strategies, and combination approaches with standard antimicrobial therapy. This review underscores the potential of HDTs to address drug resistance and persistent infections, while highlighting the importance of continued investigation into their safety and efficacy across diverse patient populations."

    "text": "Developing appropriate nanoplatforms with enhanced properties to increase the efficiency of the nano-based strategies is an urgent challenge for cancer therapy. In this work, a S, Pd modified hollow CoNiMnFe Prussian blue analogue nanocomposite (Pd-S-CNMF) was prepared as multifunctional nanoplatform for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided for combined cascade catalyzed therapy and low-temperature photothermal therapy. We found that the co-modification of S and Pd on CNMF could enhance the responsive feature the as-prepared nanocomposite to acidic environment, which endowed the Pd-S-CNMF with multiple enzyme mimicking activities and enhanced NIR light absorption. To construct efficient nanoplatform for prostate cancer therapy, a HSP 90 protein inhibitor, tanespimycin was loaded on Pd-S-CNMF (17Pd-S-CNMF) to inhibit the level of HSP 90 protein, thus increasing the outcome of subsequent photothermal therapy. The constructed 17Pd-S-CNMF is expected to remodel tumor microenvironment (TME), generate sufficient highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hyperthermia to enhance the efficacy of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). In addition, comparing to the pristine CNMF and S doped CNMF, the as-prepared Pd-S-CNMF possessed superior magnetic TME sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performance. Benefiting from these amazing properties, the as-prepared 17Pd-S-CNMF could effectively inhibit the growth of prostate cancer in vitro and vivo. Our findings provide a paradigm for construction of efficient nanocomposites as nanoplatform for cancer diagnose and treatment."

A PH mouse model was established using SU5416 combined with hypoxia (Su/Hy) in both wild-type and TOP2A knockout mice. Echocardiography, hemodynamic measurements, and histological analyses were performed to assess pulmonary vascular remodeling and right ventricular function. Human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were exposed to hypoxia to mimic PH in vitro. TOP2A and YTHDF1 were knocked down or overexpressed in PASMCs using shRNAs or overexpression plasmids. Cell proliferation, migration, inflammation, oxidative stress, and autophagy were evaluated using various biological assays. RIP and MeRIP assays were conducted to investigate the interaction between YTHDF1 and TOP2A mRNA. Data showed that TOP2A expression was significantly elevated in the lung tissues of Su/Hy-induced PH mice and hypoxia-exposed PASMCs. Functionally, TOP2A depletion in mice attenuated pulmonary vascular remodeling, improved right ventricular function, reduced macrophage activation, and decreased inflammation and oxidative stress markers. Similarly, in hypoxia-treated PASMCs, TOP2A silencing inhibited cell proliferation, migration, inflammatory cytokine production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and autophagy-related protein expression. Furthermore, elevated m6A levels and increased YTHDF1 expression were observed in PH models, and we found that YTHDF1 bound to m6A-modified TOP2A mRNA to enhance its translation. Additionally, YTHDF1 knockdown reduced TOP2A protein expression and mitigated hypoxia-induced PASMCs dysfunction, while TOP2A overexpression reversed these protective effects. Mechanistically, TOP2A activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, driving PASMCs proliferation and migration. Collectively, this study identifies YTHDF1-mediated m6A modification as a key regulator of TOP2A expression, which promotes PASMCs dysfunction and vascular remodeling in PH via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway."

Therefore, improving treatment methods is essential for the management of this cancer. Turmerones, which are the main volatile natural components of Curcuma longa Linn, have shown a number of beneficial biological activities both in vitro and in vivo. However, because of their hydrophobicity, their delivery methods need substantial improvement. Niosomes, which are made of non-ionic surfactants, have shown promising results in drug delivery systems (DDSs). Due to their appropriate encapsulation rate, stability, bioavailability, and predictable release patterns, they could be useful tools in DDSs. In this study, we demonstrated the benefit of treatment with turmerone-loaded niosomes on cancerous phenotypes of two HCC cell line in vitro and in vivo.\n\nMETHOD: Turmerone-loaded niosomes were synthesized through thin-film hydration method and characterized with dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). The impact of turmerone-loaded niosomes on Huh-7 and Hep3B cells were assessed in vitro in term of gene expression, protein production, apoptosis, cell cycle, and some functional assessments such as colony formation potential and migration. Furthermore, tumorigenesis potential of the turmerone-loaded niosomes treated hepatoma cells was assessed in an in vivo model using nude mice.\n\nRESULTS: Our in vitro experiments showed that turmerone-loaded niosomes induced apoptosis (26.04 % for Huh-7 and 29.7 % for Hep3B) and cell cycle arrest in Huh-7 and Hep3B cells. Additionally, turmerone-loaded niosomes treatment down-regulated EMT-inducing genes and significantly decreased the EMT phenotype, as well as decreased colony formation capacity in both cell lines (surviving fraction of 0.27 for Huh-7 and 0.032 for Hep3B). In vivo study showed that upon transplantation, hepatoma cells which have been pre-treated with turmerone-loaded niosomes have less growth rate and produced smaller tumors with significantly few proliferating cells in nude mice.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study showed that turmerone delivery through niosome have higher anti-cancer potentials in comparison to free-turmerone treatment on HCC cell line. Therefore, this approach could have a promising therapeutic potential in combination with other approved clinical settings for HCC treatment."

Excess extracellular PPi (ePPi) inhibits mineralization and affected children prematurely shed deciduous teeth and often suffer weakness and rickets. Yet, HPP severity is greatest among all dento-osseous disorders and not fully explained by autosomal dominant versus autosomal recessive inheritance involving >470 ALPL mutations. Discordance of HPP phenotype sometimes manifests even among full siblings sharing an identical ALPL genotype. Herein, a girl's markedly discordant HPP featured at presentation life-threatening hypercalcemia, failure-to-thrive, and renal compromise. Subsequent pseudotumor cerebri syndrome caused blindness, and then craniosynostosis required cranial vault reconstruction. However, she was not deformed, had moderate hypophosphatasemia, normal plasma PLP level, and mild radiographic features of HPP rickets. Elevated plasma N-terminal parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) suggested malignancy, but corrected after kidney transplantation. HPP was diagnosed when whole exome sequencing revealed heterozygous ALPL c.1034C>T, p.A345V found in mild pediatric HPP and transmitted by her mother who considered herself well. Genes conditioning ePPi formation and underlying other skeletal diseases were intact. Hypercalcemia, unresponsive to bone antiresorptive drugs, corrected promptly with asfotase alfa TNSALP supplementation therapy. Her markedly discordant findings highlight genotype/phenotype plasticity for pediatric HPP, and her clinical course importance for early diagnosis."

The metabolite profiles of mature human milk (MHM) have been reported to be affected by maternal physiological conditions, lactation stage, and maternal diets. We collected MHM (3-6 months postpartum) from 32 healthy mothers with different parities and delivery modes. Then, GC-MS and LC-MS were used to perform an untargeted metabolomic study. A clear distinction can be observed in terms of MHM metabolites of mothers with different delivery modes and parities with a 95% confidence interval. A total of 119 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were identified in MHM of women with different delivery modes. Metabolic pathway analyses indicated that these DEMs were mainly associated with fatty acid biosynthesis. The higher abundances of these DEMs in MHM of cesarean women may be due to the differing levels of cortisol and oxytocin between mothers with different delivery modes. Meanwhile, 284 DEMs were identified in MHM of women with different parities. These DEMs were primarily related to ABC transporters, center carbon metabolism in cancer, and D-amino acid metabolism. These findings highlighted the impact of delivery mode and parity on HM metabolite composition. Further research is needed to explore the long-term health implications of these metabolic differences and optimize infant nutrition strategies."

The chimera was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and demonstrated strong antigenicity, effectively recognizing sera from hamsters infected with diverse Leptospira serovars, indicating its non-serovar-specific nature (P < 0.001). ELISA assays were conducted using 80 human sera previously characterized by MAT. In the acute phase, IgM detection achieved 95 % of sensitivity and specificity (cut-off = 0.15, AUC = 0.990; P < 0.001). In the convalescent phase, IgG detection showed 80 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity (cut-off = 0.16, AUC = 0.968; P < 0.001). When the unknown disease phase were assessed, both IgG and IgM ELISAs maintained high diagnostic performance, with sensitivities and specificities ≥95 % and AUC values above 0.98. These findings highlight the ErpY-LemA chimera as a promising antigen for the development of a rapid, cost-effective serological diagnostic test for human leptospirosis, with high sensitivity and specificity regardless of disease stage or infecting serovar."

The MTS-hydrogel platform was subjected to PEFs varying in pulse width and electric field (EF) strength. Treated MTS were monitored and evaluated for viability and proliferation (Live/Dead imaging, XTT Cell Viability Assay), and migration (brightfield imaging) over 5 days post-treatment. In vitro experimentation was validated with a multi-layered spheroid finite element model, evaluating transmembrane potential (TMP), pore density, and pore formation across the spheroid layers. MTS exposed to longer pulse widths (5, 100 μs) and higher EFs (2000, 2500 V/cm) experienced a complete ablation. Smaller pulse widths and lower EFs produced partial ablations initially reducing the MTS, but unable to prevent the MTS from recuperating. Similarly shown with the computational model, a TMP was accomplished through the MTS, inducing electroporation; however, pore formation was dictated by the increase in pulse width and EF beyond the superficial layer. EFs of 2000 V/cm and above severely constrained the migration independent of pulse width."

Despite advancements in DTA prediction through deep learning, several fundamental challenges persist: (i) suboptimal information propagation in molecular graphs, limiting the effective representation of complex drug structures, (ii) accurately modeling the complex interactions between drug-binding sites and protein substructures, and (iii) prioritizing critical substructure interactions to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. To address these challenges, the DICCA-DTA framework is introduced, aiming to improve the contextual integration of molecular information and facilitate a more comprehensive representation of drug-target interactions in allopathic research. It employs a Diffused Isomorphic Network (DIN) to extract comprehensive drug features from molecular graphs, capturing both local substructures and global information. Furthermore, a Contextualized Capsule Attention Network (CCAN) module incorporates multi-head attention with capsule networks to capture both local and global protein sequence characteristics. The attention-guided Factorized Cross-Pooling (FCP) mechanism dynamically refines drug-protein interaction modeling by selectively emphasizing critical binding site interactions, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy. Explainable attention maps further reveal the most crucial drug-protein binding site interactions, providing transparent insights into the model's decision-making process. Comprehensive evaluations across the Davis, KIBA, Metz and BindingDB datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the DICCA-DTA framework over existing state-of-the-art models. A case study on cancer-related protein interactions from the DrugBank database further demonstrates the framework's precision in identifying key drug-protein affinities, reinforcing its potential to accelerate drug discovery and repurposing."

By employing this method, researchers can pinpoint biological pathways that exhibit a higher level of enrichment for a given set of genes than would be anticipated by random chance. These biological pathways play a crucial role in understanding the disease pathophysiology, therapeutic strategy, polypharmacological effects, synergistic mechanisms, and target engagement. However many of the available tools do not fulfill this requirement as most of the available tools consider a flat hierarchy of protein involvement in the pathway and do not consider topological information or importance of molecules in the pathway. Here we propose a novel method to enrich the molecular pathways and prioritize them based on their importance and crucial role in the biological function using the graph and evidence-based approach and customized datasets called PathwayMind. It includes 2648 pathways, 4539 biological events, 2465847 protein-protein interactions and 124717 gene-to-pathway relationships and the role of 3510 unique initial genes in 11,992 molecular pathways. The current manuscript comprises three major steps: The first step is about the data extraction and datasets creation for pathway enrichment, and the second steps comprises pathway perturbation analysis to identify most perturbed biological pathways and the third steps includes validation of this approach along with standalone tools and visualization algorithms which disclose the molecular involvement and improve the interpretability of the results. The end-to-end pathway analysis can be performed in a few minutes to provide complete insights of your target or drug of interest. The current PathwayMind tool and its datasets could be very useful for the molecular scientists and system biologists who are interested to understand the therapeutic effects of their drugs or understanding the involvement of biological pathways for specific gene sets which does not require any prior bioinformatics training."

    "text": "Accurately predicting drug-target interactions (DTI) is crucial for drug discovery and can reduce drug development costs. Recent deep learning-based DTI predictions have demonstrated promising performance, but they still face two challenges: (i) The over-reliance on the extraction of local features and insufficient learning of global features limit the model's performance. (ii) The lack of effective fusion of drug-target interaction features leads to the lack of interpretability of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a new model for predicting drug-target interactions based on multi-order gated convolution and multi-attention fusion, MGMA-DTI. The drug feature encoder obtains a two-dimensional molecular graph based on the drug's SMILES string and uses a graph convolutional neural network to encode the drug features. The protein encoder is based on a multi-order gated convolution, which enhances the model's ability to capture global feature between amino acid sequences. In order to better achieve interactive learning between drugs and proteins, we designed a multi-attention fusion module that effectively captures the drug-target interaction features. Experimental results show that MGMA-DTI outperforms other baseline models on three benchmark datasets: BindingDB, BioSNAP, and Human. Case studies further demonstrate that the model provides valuable insights for drug discovery. In addition, our model provides molecular-level interpretability, which can provide more scientifically meaningful guidance."

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) exhibit inherently efficient delivery to the liver and can be engineered to carry various therapeutic substances, making them promising agents. In this study, EVs were engineered to display fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) on their surface and encapsulate miR-223 (223/F-EVs), aiming to improve steatosis and alleviate inflammation and fibrosis, respectively. Introducing the 223/F-EVs into human liver cell lines significantly reduced both basal and induced levels of lipid storage, inflammation, and fibrosis markers. Furthermore, using an FGF21-blocking antibody or miR-223 inhibitor effectively diminished the efficacy of the 223/F-EVs, confirming the essential roles of FGF21 and miR-223 in these processes. In a Choline-Deficient, l-Amino acid-defined, High-Fat Diet (CDAHFD)-fed mouse model, intravenously administered 223/F-EVs demonstrated liver-preferential delivery and a marked reduction in the MASH phenotype without compromising bone density, unlike conventional FGF21 treatment. Collectively, 223/F-EVs convey FGF21 and miR-223 exclusively to the liver, offering strategic advantages by mitigating MASH progression via multiple pathways.

SjMEP-40 was fragmented into three distinct portions-SjMEP-40 N (N-terminal), SjMEP-40 M (middle), and SjMEP-40C (C-terminal)-to determine which segment provides the best diagnostic performance compared to the whole antigen (SjMEP-40 W) for both IgG and IgM detection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to analyze archived samples from various endemic areas in the Philippines, all previously confirmed either positive or negative for Schistosoma japonicum infection through microscopy or stool PCR. Additionally, cross-reactivity tests were conducted with other parasitic infections, including paragonimiasis, clonorchiasis, and opisthorchiasis. IgG ELISA results revealed that SjMEP-40 M has the sensitivity (82.24 %) and specificity (95.97 %). On the other hand, SjMEP-40 N showed the highest sensitivity (85.5 %) and positivity rates in IgM ELISA with both microscopy and PCR-positive samples. Overall, SjMEP-40 M showed the best diagnostic results for IgG evaluation, whereas SjMEP-40 N is the fragment responsible for antigen detection at the early stage of the disease, as shown by the IgM ELISA results. The fragmented antigens might be useful in differentiating early and chronic disease."

Remdesivir also had anti-inflammatory effect which reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and inhibition of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-STING pathway.\n\nMETHODS: We evaluated the antiarthritic effects of remdesivir in a mouse model of High-fat diet (HFD) collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and in fibroblast-like synoviocytes from patients with RA. Type II collagen was administered to DBA/1J mice to induce CIA. Vehicle or remdesivir was injected subcutaneously three times a week. During 7 weeks of treatment, the arthritis score and incidence were evaluated twice a week. Flow cytometry and confocal imaging were used to evaluate CD4 + T cells in the spleen. FLSs from patients with RA were stimulated in vitro with remdesivir and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and western blotting was used to measure the expression of STING and necroptosis-related markers.\n\nRESULTS: Remdesivir administration suppressed the incidence and progression of arthritis in mice with CIA. Histological analysis revealed lower inflammation and cartilage damage scores in remdesivir-treated than in vehicle groups. Interleukin (IL)-17 + CD4 + T-cell differentiation was inhibited in the remdesivir-treated group. Furthermore, IL-17/-6/-1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein -1, and TNF-α expression was reduced in the remdesivir group. In vitro, remdesivir suppressed the expression of STING, nuclear factor-κB, RIPK3, and phosphorylated MLKL in RA-FLSs under TNF-α stimulation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The antiviral agent remdesivir suppressed arthritis by regulating Th cell differentiation, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, the STING pathway, and necroptosis."

This work investigated treatment effects between women and men in the PARAGLIDE-HF (Prospective comparison of ARNI with ARB Given following stabiLization In DEcompensated HFpEF) trial.\n\nMETHODS: In this prespecified subgroup analysis, we examined outcomes according to sex in the PARAGLIDE-HF trial. The primary endpoint was time-average proportional change in amino terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) from baseline through Weeks 4 and 8. We also examined secondary outcomes and tolerability.\n\nRESULTS: Overall, 242 women (52%) and 224 men (48%) were randomized. Women had significantly higher LVEF, worse renal function, and less comorbidities than men. In the overall population, the time-averaged reduction in NT-proBNP was significantly greater for sacubitril/valsartan (sac/val) than valsartan (ratio of change 0.85, 95% CI, 0.73-0.999). When examined according to sex, the time-averaged reduction in NT-proBNP was numerically greater with sac/val in both women (ratio of change = 0.86, 95% CI, 0.69-1.070) and men (ratio of change 0.84, 95% CI, 0.67-1.05) with no differential treatment effect (P interaction = .91). Similarly, the secondary hierarchical endpoint favored sac/val over valsartan in both women and men but was not statistically significant. Study drug dosage levels were similar across women and men and there were no sex-specific differences in the incidence of adverse events.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with mildly reduced or preserved EF >40% and a recent worsening HF event, the efficacy, safety and tolerability of sac/val vs valsartan were similar in both women and men, suggesting consistent effects across appropriately selected patients regardless of sex. Future prospective studies are needed to further evaluate sex-specific differences in treatment response of HFpEF therapies.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Prospective comparison of ARNI with ARB Given following stabiLization In DEcompensated HFpEF; NCT03988634; https://www.\n\nCLINICALTRIALS: gov/study/NCT03988634."

A common form of CKD is autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is the most inherited genetic kidney disease and affects greater than 12.5 million individuals globally. Given that there are over 400 pathogenic PKD1/PKD2 mutations in patients with ADPKD, relying solely on small molecule drugs targeting a single signaling pathway has not been effective in treating ADPKD. Urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) are naturally released by cells from the kidneys and the urinary tract, and uEVs isolated from non-disease sources have been reported to carry functional polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), the respective products of PKD1 and PKD2 genes that are mutated in ADPKD. uEVs from non-disease sources, as a result, have the potential to provide a direct solution to the root of the disease by delivering functional proteins that are mutated in ADPKD. To test our hypothesis, we first isolated uEVs from healthy mice urine and conducted a comprehensive characterization of uEVs. Then, PC1 levels and EV markers CD63 and TSG101 of uEVs were confirmed via ELISA and Western blot. Following characterization of uEVs, the in vitro cellular uptake, inhibition of cyst growth, and gene rescue ability of uEVs were demonstrated in kidney cells. Next, upon administration of uEVs in vivo, uEVs showed bioavailability and accumulation in the kidneys. Lastly, uEV treatment in ADPKD mice (Pkd1"

Results showed that SDF at a low ratio (≤ 3.5) induced a compact matrix structure, which decreased protein digestibility to 67.70 % and total amino acids release to 140.67 mg/g protein, respectively. The compaction of the noodle matrix could be attributed to the promotion of cross-linking between D-type low molecular weight gluten and γ-gliadin by a small amount of SDF, reducing lacunarity from 0.28 to 0.16. A high SDF ratio (>3.5) induced a more fragmented matrix structure, increasing protein digestibility to 76.88 %. Notably, at a higher SDF ratio (>4.5), the concentration-dependent static quenching on enzymatic sites of SDF became prominent, slightly reducing gastric protein digestibility. In summary, an SDF ratio of 2.0-2.5 helps to reduce the inhibition of SDF on protein digestion."

At the salivary level, MPs formed a dense network with artificial saliva (AS) through key hydrophobic interactions. Fluorescence spectroscopy results indicated that the primary interaction force between CECA and AS were electrostatic interaction. However, as the concentration of CECA increased, the stacking of polysaccharide chains enhanced the exposure of protein components, thereby promoting additional hydrophobic interactions with AS. In contrast, the rigid triple-helical structure of 2082 facilitated greater exposure of its protein components, leading to predominant hydrophobic interactions with AS. Texture analysis demonstrated that MPs formed an adhesive layer on the tongue surface. Molecular docking analysis revealed that MPs inhibited the activation of the bitter taste receptor TAS2R14 by MOPC through two mechanisms: reducing binding sites and blocking receptor activation. These findings provided practical applications for improving the taste of wine and offered a theoretical foundation for modulating undesirable tastes in other beverage systems."

Notably, camel-quinoa and goat-quinoa blends stood out for their elevated phenolic levels, robust antioxidant activity, and well-rounded post-digestion metabolite composition, whereas camel-almond exhibited a uniquely balanced amino acid and sugar profile. Metabolomic analysis further revealed that blended milk samples demonstrated higher capacities to activate pathways associated with amino acid biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting their potential to address nutritional gaps in single-source formulations by creating nutritionally optimized infant formulas. While initial findings are encouraging, further research is crucial to meticulously refine these milk blends as base ingredients, ensuring optimal infant health."

Sweroside (SOS), a natural iridoid glycoside derived from plants such as Swertia mussotii, Swertia pseudochinensis, and Lonicera japonica, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties. Yet, its therapeutic potential and mechanisms in UC remain unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the effects of SOS on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC and its underlying mechanisms.\n\nMETHODS: A DSS-induced UC mouse model was established to evaluate the efficacy of SOS. Inflammatory cytokine levels, intestinal barrier function (assessed via MUC2 immunofluorescence, FITC-dextran permeability, and tight junction protein analysis), and mucosal microcirculation (measured by Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging) were examined. Angiogenesis and endothelial cell (EC) damage were analyzed using ELISA, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy. Transcriptomics and molecular docking were utilized to investigate SOS-mediated pathways, with subsequent validation by qRT-PCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. Additionally, a cellular injury model was generated by treating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with DSS. Cellular inflammatory and angiogenesis-related factors were quantified via ELISA, while migration and angiogenesis capabilities of HUVECs were assessed through scratch and tube-forming assays. The expression of the VEGF and Hippo pathway-related proteins was determined by western blot.\n\nRESULTS: SOS significantly ameliorated UC symptoms, reducing weight loss, diarrhea, and DAI scores while suppressing inflammatory infiltration and cytokine release. SOS enhanced intestinal barrier integrity via tight junction upregulation and improved microcirculation by attenuating EC injury and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, SOS regulated the VEGF and Hippo pathways, a key regulator of angiogenesis, as confirmed by transcriptomics and molecular docking. In vitro, SOS protected HUVECs from DSS-induced inflammation and angiogenesis, confirming the improvement of mucosal microcirculation by modulating VEGF and Hippo pathways.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: SOS ameliorates DSS-induced UC by impacting the VEGF and Hippo pathways, thereby suppressing ECs' angiogenesis, restoring mucosal microcirculation, and mitigating intestinal inflammation. These findings highlight SOS as a promising therapeutic candidate for UC."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Whole blood sample consists of red and white blood cells, platelets, nucleic acids, proteins, and other metabolites. However, the presence of blood cells will affect the monitoring of biomarker in plasma. To obtain plasma from microscale whole blood, plasma separation membranes are commonly used. However, obtaining high-purity plasma within a short time in point-of-care cases still remains a significant challenge. It is evident that achieving high yield/purity and high recovery rate of markers plasma separation from microliters of whole blood in an extremely short time is crucial for the point-of-care (POC) testing.\n\nRESULTS: Here, we propose dual-gradient (structural\\wetting gradient) plasma separation membranes (DG-PSMs) to effectively address the above issue. Specifically, the upper layer of DG-PSM pre-treated by blood-typing antibody exhibits hydrophobicity, which can promote red blood cell (RBC) agglutination reaction. In addition, the wetting gradient can generate wetting gradient force, which also facilitates the rapid transport of plasma. As a result, the DG-PSM can extract extremely pure plasma (∼99.99 %) from ∼15 μL whole blood. More importantly, the plasma separation costs only 15 s, far less than that of other traditional plasma separation membranes (e.g., 5-10 min). The flash separation process reduces the possibility of entanglement/absorption of protein by paper fibers, achieving an ultra-high protein recovery rate (∼98.88 %). In addition, the DG-PSM is comparable to centrifugation in avoiding hemolysis of RBCs.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: More importantly, the plasma separated by DG-PSM was tested for blood glucose detection by integrating microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) and colorimetric assays, which achieved rapid blood glucose detection (∼20 s). The DG-PSM promotes the realization of plasma separation and detection on lab-on-a-chip. We believe DG-PSM can be integrated into more detection devices to benefit mankind in remote areas and developing countries."

Our findings indicated that higher concentrations of carbamates, possibly from the diet, may significant be associated with oxidative stress, amino acid metabolism, and mitochondrial energy metabolism in CKD patients. Integrating machine learning approach identified l-glutamine (L-Glu), 3-chlorotyrosine, and N2,N2-dimethylguanosine as potential biomarkers of pesticide exposure, with an area under the curve of >0.903 based on machine learning- a receiver operating characteristic analysis. Both CKD and pesticide exposure were associated with abnormalities in amino acid and energy metabolism. Key metabolites such as L-cysteine, Acetyl-CoA, L-Glu, and L-histidine were identified as endogenous markers capable of predicting changes in both renal dysfunction and pesticide exposure among CKD patients. Detecting exposure-related metabolic alterations through metabolomics enables early identification and aids in the understanding and potential prevention of kidney disease progression.

However, current delivery methods are either invasive or inefficient due to low bioavailability. Therefore, an alternative route of administration is needed. Pulmonary delivery is a promising option as it can provide high bioavailability and a rapid onset of action. Beyond systemic analgesia, NAL has also shown local therapeutic benefits in the lungs. This study aimed to develop inhalable NAL powders using spray drying, with leucine and human serum albumin (HSA) as dispersion enhancers. The resulting powders were amorphous and contained <4 % residual solvent by mass. The spray dried particles were spherical, 3-4 µm large, and exhibited corrugated surface. Spray dried NAL alone were inhalable, with a fine particle fraction <5 µm (FPF) at 25 %. The addition of HSA improved the FPF to 33 % and 37 % for 10 % and 20 % w/w HSA, respectively. Similarly, the FPF increased to 39 % after adding 10 % w/w leucine, reaching a maximum of 47 % with 20 % w/w leucine. The latter formulation also demonstrated good chemical and physical stability after one month of storage at 25 °C under both 30 % and 60 % relative humidity. These formulations can be used as a platform to deliver NAL and other opioid analgesics by inhalation."

Epidermal growth factor-like repeats and discoidin I-like domains 3 (EDIL3) is a matrix protein associated with the onset and progression of various diseases, yet its role in PH remains unexamined. This research aims to assess the expression of EDIL3 in PH and to investigate its underlying mechanisms in the condition. Our results indicated that EDIL3 levels are elevated in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH), as well as in hypoxia-treated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) compared to normoxia-treated controls. Additionally, a mouse model of PH induced by SU5416 along with hypoxia (Su/Hx) also expressed elevated EDIL3 levels. We discovered that EDIL3 knockdown diminished the proliferation and migration of PASMCs. Mechanically, we identified an interaction between EDIL3 and integrin αVβ3. The regulation of PASMCs proliferation by EDIL3 was disrupted by cilengitide, an RGD pentapeptide that serves as a potent and selective inhibitor of integrin αVβ3. Furthermore, recombinant EDIL3 significantly increased the level of p-ERK1/2, an effect that was blocked by cilengitide, while p-p38 and p-JNK levels remained unchanged. In summary, our study introduces a novel therapeutic strategy for treating PAH and highlights a new serum biomarker for its diagnosis."

Cell-based assays for antigen-specific antibodies and IgG binding to the surface of live hippocampal neurons were performed on 13 CSFs and 65 sera, many sampled longitudinally, from 34 Vietnamese children with JE. Three month outcomes were scored according to a pediatric post-encephalitis scale; clinical features focussed on new onset symptoms during the follow-up, blinded to antibody results. Ten/34 children (29 %) had serum antibodies against known neuronal-surface antigens, 4 NMDAR, 4 CASPR2, 1 GABAAR and 1 LGI1, detected from day 23 after onset. In addition, 8/10 (80 %) of these children and 13/24 (54 %) others had antibodies that bound in a distinctive pattern to live hippocampal neurons (HN-Abs), four detected on days 9-12. A relapse was only considered possible in 5 patients, two with specific neuronal surface antibodies (NSAbs). Neither specific NSAbs (p = 1.00) nor HN-Abs (p = 1.00).were more common in patients with possible relapse than in those with unlikely relapse. There was a modest trend towards worse outcome scores in patients with known NSAbs than in the remaining patients (p = 0.089). Antibodies to neuronal surface proteins, known and unknown, are common in children after JE. Caution is urged in defining post-infectious autoimmune encephalitis on the basis of a positive neuronal antibody and new onset symptoms or deterioration following recovery from JE, or in initiating immunotherapy without confirmatory evidence of a time-dependent encephalitic illness defined by published guidelines."

    "text": "The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is well-known for its exceptionally high taurine content, but the mechanisms underlying taurine biosynthesis remain largely unexplored. Thecysteamine (AET) pathway is one of the primary metabolic routes involved in taurine biosynthesis, and its role in mollusk taurine synthesis has garnered increasing recognition. In the present study, a cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO) homolog CgADO, the central enzyme of the AET pathway, was identified in C. gigas, which contained a typical PCO_ADO domain. The transcripts of CgADO were constitutively expressed in examined oyster tissues, with the highest level detected in the adductor muscle while the lowest in the hepatopancreas. The recombinant CgADO protein, expressed in Escherichia coli, was capable of converting cysteamine to hypotaurine. Overexpression of CgADO in HEK293T cells increased the production of taurine by 20.31-fold, compared to cells transfected with the empty vector. Inhibition of endogenous CgADO expression using RNA interference resulted in a 49% reduction in its mRNA expression and an 8% decline in taurine content in the adductor muscle of oysters. These results indicated that CgADO functioned as a cysteamine dioxygenase and played a certain role in taurine biosynthesis in C. gigas."

    "text": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, has shown therapeutic potential for treating inflammatory respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. However, the therapeutic efficacy of CBD is limited by extensive hepatic metabolism and low oral bioavailability (approximately 20 %). These problems can be overcome by choosing an appropriate targeted drug delivery system. Delivering CBD to the lungs via a dry powder formulation could be an effective method to achieve adequate concentration and therapeutic efficacy. This study aims to develop a dry powder formulation of CBD with Inulin (INU) and L-leucine (LEC) using spray drying and to characterize its physicochemical and aerodynamic properties. A design of experiments (DOE) approach was used to optimize the formulation by varying feed concentration (0.2 % w/v to 0.8 % w/v), LEC concentration (5 % w/w to 20 % w/w), and CBD concentration (5 % w/w to 20 % w/w). The resulting CBD dry powder formulations exhibited a wrinkled morphology with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 5 µm and displayed a crystalline structure, as determined by powder X-ray diffraction. The response surface method (RSM) showed that increasing the feed concentration correlated with higher yields of the CBD formulations. Specifically, the formulation with a feed concentration of 0.8 % w/v achieved a yield of 61 %. The aerosolization data demonstrated a direct relationship between the Fine Particle Fraction (FPF) and LEC concentration, indicating that FPF increases as the LEC concentration increases. The highest FPF of 62 % was achieved with a 20 % w/w LEC concentration and a feed concentration of 0.2 % w/v. Based on this, LEC plays a crucial role in enhancing aerosolization efficiency. While feed concentration negatively affects FPF, lower feed concentrations lead to an increase in FPF. The Fine Particle Dose (FPD) varied with the concentration of CBD, with higher concentrations resulting in a higher FPD. A 28 days stability study under different humidity conditions (<15 % and 53 %) confirmed the stability of the CBD formulations. INU and LEC exhibited minimal cytotoxicity on A549 cells, while the raw CBD and CBD formulations showed comparable levels of cytotoxicity, pIC"

    "text": "Microneedles (MNs) are minimally invasive devices that facilitate transdermal delivery by creating micropores in the stratum corneum, the skin's outermost barrier. This property renders them particularly suitable for the delivery of biologics - large, structurally complex, and often unstable therapeutic agents such as proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, vaccines, and live cells or microorganisms. MNs offer a painless, self-administrable, and user-friendly alternative to conventional parenteral routes that often require trained personnel, generate hazardous waste, and result in low patient compliance. Since their first description in the 1990s, a wide variety of MN systems have been developed including solid, hollow, coated, dissolving, and hydrogel-forming, each with distinct fabrication and formulation requirements. This review provides a detailed and comparative discussion on formulation strategies tailored for the efficient delivery of different classes of biologics using MNs, with emphasis on the physicochemical and biological interactions at the skin interface. Special attention is given to sterilization, an often-overlooked yet regulatory-critical aspect, highlighting its importance for product safety, bioburden control, and biologic stability. Both terminal sterilization methods and aseptic manufacturing approaches are reviewed along with emerging alternatives such as self-sterilizing MNs. The review also provides a comprehensive overview of biologic-loaded MNs currently undergoing clinical evaluation. While previous reviews have focused on materials or fabrication aspects, this article presents a formulation-centric analysis, integrating physicochemical considerations, delivery challenges, and clinical translation pathways. The goal is to provide formulation scientists and translational researchers with a practical guide to MN-enabled biologic delivery systems, from bench to bedside."

To investigate potential therapeutic interventions, this study focused on the effects of CYT997, a novel anti-cancer drug, on hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HSFs). HS tissues were collected from patients and compared with normal skin samples. CYT997 decreased HSF viability in a concentration-dependent manner, with a selected concentration for further experiments. It selectively induced apoptosis in HSFs but not in normal fibroblasts, as shown by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. CYT997 also reduced HSF migration, contractility, and expression of collagen I and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), indicating decreased fibrosis. In a rabbit ear hypertrophic scar model, CYT997 treatment inhibited scar formation, reduced the scar elevation index, and promoted apoptosis in HSFs. It also regulated apoptosis-related proteins poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 in HSFs. These findings suggest that CYT997 has potential as a targeted therapy for hypertrophic scars by inducing apoptosis in HSFs and reducing fibrotic activity."

PA and depressive symptoms were assessed using self-report scales. The WCS was calculated by subtracting self-reported average weekday sleep hours from weekend sleep hours, and serum hsCRP levels were measured using immunoturbidimetric methods. Given that depressive symptoms are characterized by their multifaceted nature, we identified specific symptoms associated with hsCRP levels. Path analysis was used to investigate the association between PA, WCS, hsCRP, and depressive symptoms, and that between PA, WCS, hsCRP, and specific symptoms related to hsCRP.\n\nRESULTS: Higher levels of PA and WCS were associated with a decreased risk of depressive symptoms through lowering hsCRP levels. Among various depressive symptoms, sleep problems and appetite changes were associated with hsCRP. In pathway analyses using them as dependent variables, higher levels of PA and WCS were also associated with a decreased risk of sleep problems and appetite changes through lowering hsCRP levels.\n\nLIMITATIONS: The current study employed a cross-sectional design, and WCS and PA were based on participants' self-reports rather than objective measurements.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of PA and WCS may help alleviate depressive symptoms, particularly sleep problems and appetite changes, by mitigating chronic inflammation. Therefore, ensuring adequate exercise time and compensating for inadequate weekday sleep during weekends are crucial for maintaining mental well-being."

Their proteins, hydrolysates and peptides exhibit diverse bioactivities, including anti-obesity, anti-cancer, antioxidant, and anti-hypertensive effects, as well as functional properties such as emulsification, foaming and gelling. However, their practical utilization is hindered by challenges such as high production costs and environmental sensitivity, particularly in relation to pH, temperature, and light, which can affect their structural stability and functional performance.

Despite its benefits, PEGylated proteins are often heterogeneous mixtures containing positional isoforms that are challenging to eliminate and can significantly impact the biological activity of drugs. This study developed a reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) method for the separation and quantification of positional isoforms in commercial PEGylated recombinant human growth hormone (PEG-rhGH) at the peptide level. In this strategy, PEG-rhGH was digested into peptides via trypsin treatment and then separated and quantified using RP-UPLC. Under the chromatography condition optimized from Quality by Design (QbD) principles, this method can effectively distinguish the PEGylated peptides in five isomers. MALDI-TOF MS, SDS-PAGE and Edman degradation indicated that each of these five isomers was conjugated with one 40 kDa branched PEG at a specific lysine residue and the N-terminal. Through the concentration correction of PEGylated peptides varying in sequence lengths, the proportion of five modified sites can be quantified. The comparative assay showed that this strategy effectively addresses the limitations of the commonly used IEC method, especially under challenging conditions like post-translational modifications (e.g., oxidation, deamidation, and cyclization) and conformational changes. As a result, it offers improved robustness and accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed RP-UPLC method exhibited outstanding repeatability across various storage conditions, making it a reliable tool for quality control and product release in the biopharmaceutical industry."

In contrast to oral administration, inhaled therapy offers enhanced therapeutic efficacy at the target organ while minimizing systemic side effects. However, its application has challenges, such as limited drug delivery to the distal lung region and rapid clearance. In this study, we developed pulmonary surfactant (PS)-based PFD-loaded nanovesicles (PFD-PSNVs) for targeted delivery to the lung area and prolonged retention and examined their safety, stability, and antifibrotic efficacy. PFD-PSNVs were prepared using the thin-film hydration and extrusion method. The mean size and zeta potential of PFD-PSNVs were 149.7 ± 10.1 nm and - 31.3 ± 2.3 mV, respectively. An in vitro antifibrotic study showed that PFD-PSNVs inhibited the expression of fibrotic factors such as p-ERK, p-SMAD2/3, and α-SMA proteins on fibroblasts activated by transforming growth factor-β1. When inhaled in mice using a nebulizer, the PFD-PSNVs remained in lung tissues for 24 h, whereas Arikayce, an FDA-approved liposomal formulation for inhalation, was eliminated within 6 h.

This pipeline integrated differential gene expression analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and functional enrichment analysis to identify key hub genes associated with tumor progression. We subsequently applied principal component analysis (PCA) and overall survival modeling to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of these candidates. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess their sensitivity and specificity. Finally, experimental validation of the prioritized hub genes was conducted via qPCR across three CRC cell lines (LoVo, HCT-116, and HT-29), confirming their upregulation and supporting their clinical potential.\n\nRESULTS: Our integrative pipeline prioritized five key hub genes (CDH3, CXCL1, MMP1, MMP3, and TGFBI) as significantly upregulated in COAD tissues compared to normal controls. Functional enrichment analysis linked these genes to extracellular matrix degradation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), inflammatory signaling, and tumor invasion, underscoring their roles in key oncogenic processes. Survival analysis revealed varying degrees of association with patient prognosis, most notably for CXCL1. Diagnostic performance, assessed by ROC analysis, yielded moderate AUC values (0.669-0.692), supporting their potential as biomarkers. Finally, qPCR validation across three CRC cell lines confirmed robust upregulation of all five genes, reinforcing their biological relevance in COAD progression.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our study establishes a reproducible, integrative bioinformatics and statistical framework for the systematic identification of clinically actionable biomarkers in CRC. The five hub genes prioritized (CDH3, CXCL1, MMP1, MMP3, and TGFBI) demonstrated consistent diagnostic and prognostic value, offering a solid basis for the development of non-invasive molecular diagnostics and contributing to precision oncology."

EEG confirmed focal seizures, and brain MRI revealed polyfocal T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities involving both the white and gray matter. CSF analysis showed lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and elevated opening pressure. She was diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and treated with IV corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, IV immunoglobulins, and antiseizure medications with improvement in encephalopathy and seizures, but persistence of focal deficits. Six weeks after symptom onset, she again became critically ill with encephalopathy and a brain MRI demonstrated worsening of the previous lesions. Paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalopathy antibody testing was negative, cultures and PCR testing did not identify infection, there was no evidence of rheumatologic conditions, and no malignant cells were found in the spinal fluid. Brain biopsy demonstrated an inflammatory infiltrate, primarily composed of macrophages, T cells, and a few B cells and neutrophils. A CD107a degranulation assay demonstrated a defect in natural and cytotoxic T-cell function, and ultimately, genetic testing revealed the diagnosis. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges faced in cases of CNS immune dysregulation, including differential diagnoses, interpretation of functional assays, and genetic considerations."

We conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the causal relationships between insulin use and PND. The forward MR analysis revealed that insulin use considerably reduced the risk of delirium (odds ratio [OR] = 0.01, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.0007-0.22, P = 0.003) and enhanced cognitive performance (OR = 8.03, 95 % CI: 2.83-22.78, P = 0.001). Importantly, the reverse MR analysis indicated that cognitive impairment or delirium did not causally affect insulin use (OR ≈ 1.0, P > 0.5). Utilizing GEO datasets, we identified 63 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common to both postoperative delirium and insulin treatment. Subsequent analyses, including the construction of a protein-protein interaction network and Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses, identified EPN2, DNAJC6, ARFGAP1, and HIP1R as key hub genes that could serve as potential therapeutic targets for PND. Further research showed that these hub genes are part of a multi-pathway interactive network, which may significantly contribute to the onset and progression of PND, with insulin also affecting their regulation. Our results establish a unidirectional genetic causality for the therapeutic effects of insulin in PND and reveal new molecular targets, thereby improving our understanding of the mechanisms behind insulin treatment for PND."

Moreover, an in vivo atherosclerosis model was established by tail vein injection of AAV8-PCSK9 virus into mice who were then fed a high-fat diet. EGR3 expression was manipulated through cellular lentiviral transfection and conditional gene knockout in mice. Oil red O staining was used to assess lipid droplet and mouse aortic plaque formation. HE staining was used to observe pathological changes in mouse aortic tissue. To quantify C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, ELISA was conducted on HCAEC lysates and mouse serum samples. Western blot analysis was conducted to determine EGR3 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) protein levels and in both cellular lysates and mouse aortic tissue.\n\nRESULTS: In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that EGR3 expression was elevated in the ox-LDL group. Furthermore, in vitro studies revealed that the CRP and VCAM-1 expression levels were significantly reduced and that lipid droplet formation was inhibited by EGR3 inhibition. Consistently, CRP, VCAM-1, blood glucose and lipid levels, and the severity of atherosclerotic lesions in mice were significantly reduced in Egr3 knockout mice.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that atherosclerosis development appears to be associated with the regulation of CRP and VCAM expression by EGR3. These results suggest that targeting EGR3 may be a promising approach for treating atherosclerosis."

Building on this rationale, this study presents a series of six D-(+)-biotin-conjugated squaraine dyes derived from benzothiazole, indolenine, and benz[e]indole, with N-ethyl and N-hexyl chains. These compounds were thoroughly characterized in terms of their photophysical and photochemical properties, revealing strong absorption in the so-called \"phototherapeutic window\", notable fluorescence, especially the benzothiazole derivatives, aqueous stability, particularly the indolenine-based dyes, and moderate to high photostability. Computational studies further indicated a strong binding affinity to human serum albumin and avidin proteins. All dyes exhibited photodynamic activity, with indolenine derivatives showing remarkable tumor selectivity and benz[e]indole analogs evidencing superior photocytotoxicity. The most promising compounds preferentially accumulated in mitochondria, and both singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species were found to play a role in their photobiological effects. Additionally, they were non-genotoxic in the absence of irradiation, and apoptosis was the primary mechanism of cell death upon light activation. This was evidenced by preserved cytoplasmic membrane integrity, nuclear fragmentation, and caspase-3/7 activation, reinforcing the safety and potential of these compounds as phototherapeutic agents. Although cellular uptake via the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter was not established, and diffusion is expected to be the predominant mechanism, the high predicted avidin-binding affinity of these dyes opens exciting new avenues for photodynamic therapy-combined strategies."

Conventional MRI captures morphologic changes in neurodegeneration, while quantitative MRI (qMRI) provides biophysical measures of microstructural alterations. Combining these modalities may reveal how aging and pathology interact and contribute to disability progression in people with MS.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional and longitudinal morphometry data from 1,353 patients with MS and 3,462 healthy controls (HCs). In addition, cross-sectional qMRI data, available for 378 HCs and 169 patients with MS, were analyzed separately. Morphometric measures and quantitative metrics were used to estimate brain-predicted age differences (brain-PADs) with machine learning. We assessed the added value of quantitative metrics over a model based exclusively on morphometric measures in brain age prediction. We also investigated the associations of brain-PADs derived from conventional and qMRI-based predictive models with clinical disability, serum inflammatory biomarkers of neuroaxonal and astrocytic injury, and lesion burden.\n\nRESULTS: Models combining morphometry and qMRI data achieved the best performance (mean absolute error: 5.73), outperforming those based on qMRI (6.62) or morphometry alone (8.00). Cross-sectional and longitudinal morphometry-based brain-PAD correlated with clinical disability, serum neurofilament light chain, and serum glial fibrillary acidic protein levels (all\n\nDISCUSSION: Integrating qMRI improves brain age predictions.

Timely detection of precancerous lesions for patients with chronic HBV infection is critical in preventing worse consequences. The purpose of this study is to reveal the key serum metabolic biomarkers that can be applied to the early recognition of HCC in patients with HBV-associated cirrhosis.\n\nMETHODS: Blood samples from patients with LC, HCC, and healthy subjects were collected, and endogenous metabolites in serum were detected by ultra high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS). Differential metabolites (DM) were screened, and metabolic pathways and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signals involved in DM were analyzed.\n\nRESULTS: Metabolomics results revealed that patients with LC and HCC had significantly different metabolic characteristics. Patients with LC and HCC shared 22 biomarkers, LC had six different biomarkers, and HCC had 10 different biomarkers. The expressions of these metabolites all showed significant differences between groups. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the differential biomarkers of LC were primarily involved in the regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis, while the differential biomarkers of HCC were mainly involved in the regulation of endogenous androgen signaling, mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism, and purine metabolism signaling. The common biomarkers are enriched in bile acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism.\n\nCONCLUSION: We clarified the blood metabolism characteristics of LC and HCC. These findings provided potential endogenous metabolic indicators for early recognition of HBV-chronically infected cirrhotic patients who may progress to HCC."

While conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has provided valuable insights into these changes, such as the formation of crystalloid-ER and ER whorls, obtaining comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) information on these large structures within their cellular context has remained a challenge. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces an innovative application of dual-axis scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography to investigate ER morphology under stress conditions in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells overexpressing the cation channel polycystin-2 (PC-2). Benefitting from high-resolution, increased depth-of-focus, and reduced aberrations, STEM tomography enabled the detailed 3D reconstruction of large cellular subvolumes, providing unprecedented views of stress-induced ER structures. Our findings reveal distinct ultrastructural details of both crystalloid-ER and ER whorls. Crystalloid-ER exhibited a tubular architecture with potential interconnectedness, while ER whorls displayed a lamellar organisation and distinct membrane curvature. We observed the co-occurrence of these distinct smooth ER (sER) morphotypes within the same cell, yet they remained spatially separated, suggesting potential functional specialisation. Furthermore, we identified direct membrane contacts in mixed morphotypes, hinting at a shared origin or dynamic relationship between these structures. The study also elucidated the interactions of these organised smooth ER (OSER) structures with other organelles, such as mitochondria (MAM sites) and vesicles. In summary, the presented ultra-structural insights have a significant impact on our understanding of stress-related ER morphology changes. The ability to visualise the intricate 3D architecture and spatial relationships of these structures provides novel perspectives on the ER's adaptive responses to stress, including potential roles in lipid and protein biosynthesis and intracellular communication. These findings underscore the power of dual-axis STEM tomography for elucidating complex organellar organisation and dynamics in their native cellular context."

In this study, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293F) cells were used to generate highly active HCV E1 and E2 proteins, which were then used as antigen for producing mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Novel B cell epitopes of E1 and E2 were disclosed using monoclonal antibodies for the first time. Based on the epitopes, three multi-epitope (MEP) antigens were designed and prepared including non-structural proteins and novel identified B cell epitopes in E1 and E2 in HCV 1b, 2a, 3a, 6a subtypes. Double antigen sandwich enzyme immunoassay was established based on the MEPs to detect HCV serum antibodies, showing potential diagnostic application.

The addition of CH (2 % w/v) significantly enhanced BC production (8.15 ± 0.39 g/L dry weight), improving mechanical strength, such as tensile strength (46.3 MPa), elongation at break (35.1 %), and swelling ratio (2515 % ± 75 %), compared to the control. FTIR analysis confirmed the successful incorporation of CH and QI into the BC matrix, with shifts in amide bands and the appearance of new peaks indicating QI integration. SEM images also showed that CH and QI made BC's fibrous structure denser and less porous. Although QI slightly reduced mechanical strength, it markedly improved antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSC) assays showed enhanced viability in BC/CH2% and BC/CH2%/QI1% composites with no significant cytotoxic effects after 24 h. Fluorescent staining confirmed hADSC survival and proliferation. These findings suggest that the BC/CH/QI composites provide a favorable microenvironment for tissue regeneration and hold strong potential for skin wound healing. Further physicochemical analyses including QI release kinetics and surface area measurements are recommended to better understand the relationship between structure and bioactivity. In vivo studies will also be essential to fully evaluate their therapeutic potential and support clinical translation."

Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) derive from ancestral infections of germinal cells and represent 8 % of the human DNA. They are mostly inactive, but some can be activated. Their aberrant expressions are associated with inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. HERV transcription is modulated by TRIM28 and SETDB1, which are also directly implicated in epigenetic processes and modulation of the immune response. We reported HERV overexpressions in CeD children at diagnosis. In the current prospective study, using a PCR real-time Taqman amplification assay, we explored the transcription levels of HERV-H-pol, -HERV-K-pol, and HERV-W-pol, of syncytin 1 (SYN1), SYN2, and HERV-W-env, as well as of TRIM28 and SETDB1 in the whole blood from 51 adults with CeD after years of good compliance with gluten-free diet (GFD) as compared to healthy controls (HC) of similar age. The transcriptional levels of every HERV and of TRIM28/SETDB1 were significantly higher in CeD patients than in HC (constantly with p < 0.0001). Positive correlations were found between the RNA levels of TRIM28 or SETDB1 and HERVs in CeD patients. The upregulation of HERVs, TRIM28, and SETDB1 and their positive correlations are suggestive clues of their contribution to the pathophysiology of CeD and might justify the persistent risk of developing, despite GFD, autoimmune diseases, neuropsychiatric disturbances, and cancers, all disorders characterized by enhanced HERV expressions and epigenetic alterations."

A curated dataset of 5000 bioactive molecules was obtained from ChEMBL, and structural motifs associated with bioactivity were identified using a genetic programming-based approach. Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting classifiers were trained and cross-validated using 10-fold cross-validation to predict pIC50 values, achieving high performance (mean accuracy: 0.98, AUC >0.97). Feature importance analysis consistently identified pIC50, molecular weight (MW), lipophilicity (LogP), and hydrogen-bonding properties as primary determinants of bioactivity. PPI networks were built using STRING's experimentally validated interactions and refined using BioGRID and literature cross-validation. Network centrality analysis and community detection using the Girvan-Newman algorithm revealed MYC, MAX, and EP300 as central hubs, with associated protein modules significantly enriched for biological processes including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, ubiquitination, and apoptosis. To enhance model interpretability, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods, including SHAP and DALEX, were employed to elucidate the contribution of individual molecular descriptors, mechanistically elucidating compound-target interactions. Despite its robustness, this computational framework lacks experimental validation and independent external datasets. Additionally, STRING's uniform confidence scores limited edge-weight precision in network visualizations during network analyses. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates the potential of a multi-layered computational approach to deepen the understanding of MYC-driven oncogenesis in PCC. By integrating motif discovery, network biology, and interpretable machine learning, the work identifies actionable molecular signatures and critical protein targets, providing a foundation for future experimental validation and the development of targeted therapies in pheochromocytoma as well as other rare cancers."

    "text": "Ferroptosis plays a crucial role in the development of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and it is closely associated with oxidative stress. Low-molecular-weight fucoidan (LMWF) has been shown to exert an inhibitory action on oxidative stress. Herein, we investigated whether using LMWF to treat DKD is associated with ferroptosis and evaluated the action of LMWF on DKD using both in vivo and in vitro models. The in vivo DKD model was established by administering a high-glucose and high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin, and H&E and Masson staining were used to observe pathological changes in the kidney and collagen deposition. We assessed GSH, GSSG, and MDA to evaluate oxidative stress and utilized metabolomics to explore potential pathways of action. Prussian blue staining, analysis of 4-HNE and LPO, and PCR array for ferroptosis detection were adopted to observe renal ferroptosis. Our results indicated that LMWF inhibited the progression of DKD while reducing MDA content and increasing GSH content, and metabolomic analysis showed that ferroptosis was the potential mechanism responsible for the effect. Prussian blue staining and 4-HNE, LPO, and PCR assays further confirmed this conclusion. We constructed an in vitro model of HK-2 cells treated with high glucose and intervened with LMWF; this demonstrated that LMWF achieved therapeutic effects in vitro, as LMWF reduced ROS expression and inhibited apoptosis. To investigate the mechanism of action of LMWF treatment after intervention with a ferroptosis inducer (Erastin), western blot analysis and showed that LMWF inhibited DKD through Nrf-2/Keap-1 and SLC7A11/GSH/GPX4 signaling pathways."

Derived from legumes, grains, seeds, and nuts, they provide essential amino acids such as leucine, lysine, methionine, and tryptophan. Soy protein offers 36-40 % protein content with a complete amino acid profile, while pea protein exhibits ~80 % digestibility and high arginine levels (~8.7 g/100 g). Substituting animal proteins with plant-based options may reduce LDL cholesterol by 5-10 % and lower type 2 diabetes risk by 18 %. Environmentally, they contribute up to 90 % fewer greenhouse gas emissions and use 75 % less water than red meat proteins. Structural variations in plant proteins influence their solubility, emulsification, and gelation-critical factors in food formulation. Improved emulsifying activity, such as a 25 % increase with heat-modified lupin proteins, enhances texture and stability. Additionally, plant proteins find applications in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and biodegradable packaging. This review highlights their composition, functional and structural properties, industrial applications, and novel processing technologies like enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation to enhance digestibility and bioavailability, positioning plant proteins as vital agents of human health and sustainability."

LAT1 has emerged as a key therapeutic target in cancer due to its upregulation in different tumor types. We generated and characterized LAT1- and LAT2-expressing cells using the human MDST8 cell line lacking these transporters to evaluate the specificity and selectivity of the clinical candidate JPH203 and novel LAT1 inhibitors. Both LAT1 and LAT2 increased the expression of 4F2hc, a heavy chain protein essential for LAT1 functioning and AA transport. We show for the first time that two potent nanomolar LAT1 inhibitors, JPH203 and JX-078, can enter cells through LAT1-independent mechanisms and inhibit LAT1-mediated L-leucine efflux, giving rise to differential cell type and time-dependent effects on the AA metabolome and metabolic activity in cancer cells and human PBMCs. Intriguingly, the antiproliferative effects of JPH203 and JX-078 on MDST8 cells were LAT1-independent, showing also micromolar IC50 values in HT-29 and U937 cells that overexpress LAT1. We found notable differences in the bioavailability of LAT1 inhibitors in mice. Oral administration of JX-078 efficiently penetrated tissues and crossed the blood-brain barrier, leading to increased levels of inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and GABA in the brain. This study demonstrates the utility of employing targeted metabolomics to interrogate LAT1/2 inhibitor selectivity in different physiological matrices in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Overall, our findings reveal LAT1-dependent and previously unrecognized LAT-independent effects of inhibitors believed to act specifically on LAT1."

The combination of plant polyphenols and photothermal therapy offers multiple advantages for skin wound repair and represents a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics. However, most plant polyphenols are susceptible to chemical degradation and inherently lack photothermal responsiveness. In this study, protocatechualdehyde (PA), a plant polyphenol with diverse bioactivities, was selected. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was modified through acetalization with PA to obtain polyvinyl protocatechualdehyde acetal (PPA). Subsequently, the catechol groups of PA were enzymatically cross-linked using HRP/H₂O₂ to form a hydrogel. This acetal-grafting strategy not only shielded the functional groups of PA from excessive degradation, but also conferred acid-responsive properties to the hydrogel, thereby facilitating the sustained release of bioactive PA and its oligomers at the acidic microenvironment of the wound. Although native PA lacks photothermal activity, the HRP/H₂O₂-induced formation of dimeric and oligomeric PA structures endowed the hydrogel with intrinsic photothermal responsiveness, eliminating the need for additional photothermal agents. The PPA hydrogel exhibited excellent adhesion, hemostatic performance, photothermal conversion efficiency, antioxidant, antibacterial properties, and biocompatibility. When combined with photothermal therapy in a mouse infected wound model, the PPA hydrogel significantly accelerated wound closure, reduced local inflammation, promoted tissue regeneration and collagen deposition, highlighting its potential in skin wound repair."

Nevertheless, studies examining the clinicopathological significance of CAFs and microvessel density (MVD) in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC), as well as their implications for prognosis, are scarce. Tissue samples from 96 HPSCC patients were subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CAF markers (including FAP and α-SMA) and MVD (characterized by the CD31 marker). Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to elucidate the potential mechanisms through which CAFs exert their functions. Compared with normal hypopharyngeal tissues, HPSCC tissues exhibited a greater number of CAFs and greater MVD. The high-MVD group demonstrated increased levels of FAP and α-SMA expression, increased CAF density, and an elevated rate of lymph node metastasis. Both CAF enrichment and high MVD were significantly associated with adverse clinicopathological features in patients, thereby leading to reduced overall survival. Additionally, both MVD and lymph node metastasis were identified as being independent prognostic factors that markedly increase patient mortality risk. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that CAFs may affect tumor progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis by the PI3K-Akt, KRAS, and Hedgehog signaling pathways, as well as through mechanisms such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and ECM remodeling. CD19 may act as a potential marker for how CAFs affect the prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. In summary, our findings indicate that CAFs and the MVD may significantly influence the prognosis of HPSCC patients. Angiogenesis and immunosuppression may represent the central mechanism through which CAFs affect prognosis, as CAFs facilitate angiogenesis and immunosuppression, thereby driving tumor progression and metastasis."

To address these limitations, we engineered a human serum albumin methacryloyl (HSAMA) cryogel system incorporating key liver extracellular matrix (ECM) components, collagen I (C) and fibronectin (F), to mimic the liver's architectural complexity. By co-culturing HepG2 and HUVECs within the HSAMA-CF cryogel, we created a three-dimensional, large-pore scaffold that facilitates critical hepatocyte-endothelial cell interactions essential for liver function and drug metabolism. Over extended culture periods, the HSAMA-CF cryogel significantly enhanced liver-specific functions, including elevated albumin production, increased urea secretion, and upregulated expression of hepatic functional genes. Notably, the co-culture model successfully detected multiple hepatotoxic phenotypes-such as elevated transaminase levels, hepatocyte damage, and steatosis-following exposure to known hepatotoxins like fialuridine and acetaminophen. This HSAMA-CF co-culture system may represent a robust in vitro platform for liver toxicity assessment. By closely mimicking human liver physiology and drug responses, it might offer a promising alternative to traditional animal models, potentially improving drug safety evaluations, reducing reliance on preclinical animal testing, and minimizing risks associated with clinical drug development."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing global health concern. We adopted a multidisciplinary approach combining epidemiological analysis, network toxicology, molecular docking, and animal experiments to investigate PFOS-induced kidney injury using CKD as a model. NHANES data (n = 9119) were analyzed to examine the association between serum PFOS levels and CKD prevalence. Network toxicology identified PFOS-related target genes, which were further refined through protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and validated using the GSE32591 dataset. A diagnostic model was constructed, and molecular docking and in vivo studies were performed to verify gene-compound interactions and biological effects. Coremine Medical was used to identify traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) candidates targeting key genes. Serum PFOS levels were significantly associated with CKD, showing a U-shaped dose-response. Four hub genes-ALB, PTGS2, AKT1, and IGF1-were identified and used to develop a diagnostic model with excellent accuracy (AUC = 0.96). Molecular docking confirmed stable PFOS-protein interactions. PFOS exposure in mice led to dose-dependent renal tubular injury, elevated NGAL and KIM-1 levels, and PI3K-AKT pathway activation. Astragalus membranaceus, identified through TCM screening, exhibited strong binding to the target proteins and may have therapeutic potential. This study reveals key molecular targets and pathways involved in PFOS-induced nephrotoxicity and proposes a TCM-based therapeutic strategy.

Our preliminary findings indicated that Fc-CD80 exhibited superior anti-tumor efficacy compared to CD80-Fc in our previous study. Then, we endeavored to combine Fc-CD80 with anti-angiogenesis therapy to further enhance its therapeutic potential. Our data indicated that this combination could effectively activate T cells, inhibit angiogenesis, and increase the infiltration of immune effector cells, thereby exerting a more pronounced anti-tumor effect. More significantly, we further constructed and expressed a new bifocal fusion protein, α-VEGF-CD80, using the Fab fragment of an anti-VEGF antibody and the CD80 ECD. This protein significantly promoted immune cell infiltration into tumors and effectively suppressed tumor growth. Additionally, α-VEGF-CD80 exhibited excellent targeting specificity, an extended half-life, and favorable in vivo safety profiles.

To overcome these constraints, we developed novel amino-acid-modified Pluronic F127 hyaluronic acid hydrogels with lysine-modified F127 (Lys127/HA); thereby, emerging as the optimal formulation owing to its unique thermosensitivity and improved rheological behavior. This hydrogel remains flowable at low temperatures for sprayability and transitions to a gel under physiological temperature via physical crosslinking through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The resulting gel exhibits enhanced viscosity, extended retention, and improved mucoadhesion. When administered using a precision sprayable device in a porcine laparoscopic model, Lys127/HA significantly reduced adhesion formation, outperforming commercial crosslinked HA-based barriers. Additionally, Lys127/HA improved wound healing, suppressed inflammation, and effectively prevented fibroblast migration. Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrated excellent biocompatibility with no observable side effects. These findings establish Lys127/HA as a promising candidate for postoperative adhesion prophylaxis, especially in laparoscopic surgeries, with the potential to address limitations of existing clinical anti-adhesion strategies."

This review aims to provide an updated synthesis of knowledge regarding LATE-NC as a cause of age-related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline while addressing the challenges posed by overlapping neuropathologies in aging populations.\n\nRECENT FINDINGS: LATE-NC is marked by TDP-43 deposition in limbic structures, such as the amygdala and hippocampus, and is often associated with cognitive decline resembling Alzheimer's disease, though with a slower progression in isolated cases. The frequent coexistence of LATE-NC with other neuropathologies, particularly Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC) and Lewy body dementia (LBD), exacerbates dementia severity and complicates diagnosis and treatment. Recent efforts have established clinical criteria for in-vivo diagnosis, including neuroimaging markers like hippocampal atrophy and limbic hypometabolism. Genetic studies have identified key risk genes, including GRN, TMEM106B, SORL1, and APOE, while biomarker development in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood remains in its early stages.\n\nSUMMARY: The review highlights the importance of multidisciplinary research and clinical approaches in addressing the complexities of neurodegenerative diseases involving TDP-43 proteinopathy, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and developing effective treatments tailored to individual patient profiles."

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is a by-product of protein metabolism and is commonly used as an indicator to assess renal function. α-Klotho protein is detected mainly in the kidney and has antioxidant, anti-aging, and nephroprotective properties.\n\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between blood toluene concentration and BUN concentration and assess the α-Klotho protein's mediating role in this relationship.\n\nMETHODS: This study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2013 to 2016 on 2212 middle-aged and older Americans aged 40-79. Statistical methods such as multiple linear regression, threshold effects analysis, and mediation analysis were used to systematically assess the relationship between blood toluene concentration and BUN concentration and to explore the mediating role of α-Klotho protein.\n\nRESULTS: Blood toluene concentration was significantly negatively associated with BUN concentration (p < 0.05). The results of the multiple regression analyses showed that the negative association remained statistically significant after controlling for confounding factors such as gender, age, race and body mass index. In addition, mediation analysis indicated that α-Klotho protein partially mediated this association (p < 0.05). Subgroup analyses showed a U-shaped relationship between blood toluene concentration and BUN concentration in low-income populations.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study is the first to report a significant negative association between blood toluene concentration and BUN concentration in a middle-aged and elderly U.S. population, and suggests a potential partial mediating role of α-Klotho protein.

    "text": "This study employed a network toxicology strategy to elucidate the toxic mechanisms of polyethylene terephthalate microplastics (PET-MPs) on atherosclerosis (AS). AS is a chronic inflammatory vascular disease that may be aggravated by PET-MPs. By integrating network toxicology, molecular docking, and transcriptome analysis, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1), and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C (PTPRC) were identified as core interaction genes between PET and AS. Through bio-enrichment analysis, we discovered that the toxicity of PET is primarily associated with the cascade reaction of vascular inflammation and abnormal macrophage activation. Molecular docking experiments confirmed a strong binding affinity between PET and these targets (<-5.0 kcal/mol). In vitro results showed that PET significantly increased the mRNA levels of TNF-α, CXCR4, CX3CR1, and PTPRC, triggering an inflammatory response and causing chemokine receptor dysfunction. In an AS mouse model, increased aortic plaque area and aortic valve collagen deposition were observed, along with elevated expression of core target genes' mRNA, even without direct exposure to PET-MPs, exhibiting effects consistent with those seen in vitro. Collectively, these studies suggest that PET can induce inflammatory responses and disrupt immune system balance by regulating the expression levels of TNF, CXCR4, CX3CR1, and PTPRC, thus promoting the progression of atherosclerotic diseases. This paper provides the first comprehensive investigation into the impact and mechanisms of microplastics on AS, demonstrating how PET contributes to its development and establishing a basis for identifying new therapeutic targets for cardiovascular diseases linked to microplastics."

This study introduces a dual-layer convex patch for suture-free repair of ocular trauma, comprising a thermosensitive gelatin/alginate adhesive layer and a convex collagen substrate layer. This design addresses critical limitations of conventional adhesives, particularly their difficulty in forming symmetric curvature during application and insufficient bonding strength under intraocular pressure fluctuations. In vitro studies demonstrated that the patch possessed superior transmittance (above 80 %) and high burst pressure (above 200 mmHg). This dual-layer convex patch can reduce surgical time by two-thirds compared to the suture group. In a lamellar keratoplasty model, the patch promoted epithelial healing, enhanced stroma regeneration, and inhibited the formation of stromal scars. For irregular large-sized corneal penetrating injuries, the patch group achieved rapid wound sealing, promoted epithelial healing, and showed more symmetrical corneal curvature and 90 % reduction in neovascularization compared to fibrin. The superior performance of the dual-layer convex patch makes it a promising alternative for the suture-free treatment of corneal trauma, achieving both corneal stroma defects repair and irregular penetrating injuries healing."

We additionally uncovered DNA methylation sites that played a disproportionately important role in driving the ability of CheekAge to associate with each of these variables. We dubbed these \"pro\" CpGs because of their ability to promote a given association. Here, we identify 2639 common DNA methylation sites that were a \"pro\" CpG for at least two different health and disease signals. Using genes annotated to these common \"pro\" CpGs, we perform extensive enrichment analyses to unveil motifs of DNA repair, cell division, tumors, cancer, and inherited syndromes. We additionally show that a plethora of genes linked to these common \"pro\" CpGs have been reported to alter lifespan and/or healthspan in model organisms when manipulated. Some of these were highly germane to canonical signaling pathways, such as RPTOR (encoding for Regulatory-associated protein of mTOR) and FOXA2 (encoding for Hepatocyte nuclear factor 3-beta). We also honed in on the seven DNA methylation sites that represented the most common \"pro\" CpGs, which were cg00005888, cg02478836, cg18331022, cg01892528, cg27634071, cg09232037, and cg17841124. Not only do we summarize available literature for these sites and their annotated genes, but we show that they can be combined into a proof-of-concept epigenetic biomarker that associates with alcohol intake, diet quality, and sex. All together, we provide additional insights into DNA methylation sites that underlie CheekAge's ability to associate with meaningful signals."

A representative HIP (DD: ELA: DiA, molar ratio 1:4:0.5) was incorporated into self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) and characterized for size, zeta potential, stability, hemolytic activity, cytotoxicity, and cellular uptake. Permeability was assessed using the Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay (PAMPA) model and Caco-2 monolayers. SEDDS exhibited droplet sizes below 200 nm, a polydispersity index (PDI) < 0.4, positive surface charges, and high stability. Hemolysis studies indicated potential for endosomal escape, while dose-dependent toxicity became apparent after 4 and 24 h of incubation. Flow cytometry revealed enhanced cellular uptake: HIP and SEDDS increased internalization of DD by 12- and 32-fold, compared to free peptide. Permeation studies demonstrated marked improvements in DD transport. In the PAMPA assay, HIP and SEDDS increased passive diffusion by 2.8- and 6.5-fold. Similarly, in the Caco-2 model, HIP and SEDDS enhanced permeation by 17- and 57-fold, compared to free DD. DiA permeation remained minimal, suggesting that HIP disassociates intracellularly, allowing selective release of the peptide. These findings confirm that HIP enhances membrane permeation of DD and dissociates after uptake. The combination of HIP and SEDDS presents a robust strategy for improving the oral bioavailability of peptide therapeutics."

Angiogenesis plays a critical role in neurological recovery during cerebral ischemia. Rosavin is the main active ingredient of Rhodiola rosea for ischemic stroke treatment.\n\nPURPOSE: The study investigates the neuroprotective effects of Rosavin on ischemic stroke rats through activating HIF-1α signaling.\n\nMETHODS: In vivo studies, MCAO/IR model was employed and treatment with Rosavin, and the concentration of Rosavin in brain tissue was determined using LC-MS/MS at different time points. After 7 days of treatment, mNSS were used to assess the degree of neurological deficits in rats for evaluating the neuroprotective effects of Rosavin. MRI was used to measure cerebral infarct volume, and the Morris water maze was employed to evaluate spatial learning and memory abilities. IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 mRNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR, NeuN, Bax and Bcl-2 was detected by Western blotting. In vitro studies, the effects of Rosavin on angiogenesis were assessed using OGD/R-induced HUVEC model. Moreover, Network pharmacology was used to predict the potential mechanisms of Rosavin. To investigate Rosavin protects against MCAO/IR-induced neurological damage via HIF-1α signaling, rats were treated with the HIF-1α inhibitor YC-1. After 7 days, Western blotting and RT-qPCR were used to detect the expression levels of NeuN, HIF-1α, VEGFA, and EPO in the ischemic cortical brain tissue. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to evaluate the expression of HIF-1α, VEGFA, CD31, and NeuN.\n\nRESULTS: Rosavin (ip.) was detectable in the rat brain, with peak concentration achieved at 20 min post-administration. Rosavin significantly reduced cerebral infarct volume and mNSS scores in MCAO/IR rats. Additionally, Rosavin decreased the escape latency and increased the number of platform crossings in the Morris water maze test. In ischemic brain tissue, Rosavin reduced the number of apoptotic cells and Bax expression while increasing Bcl-2, NeuN, and CD31. Network pharmacology analysis identified 174 potential therapeutic targets of Rosavin for ischemic stroke, with enrichment analysis suggesting that it activated HIF-1α signaling. Rosavin upregulated HIF-1α protein and nuclear localization, and VEGF and EPO in the ischemic cortical brain tissue. In vitro studies showed that Rosavin inhibited OGD/R-induced tube formation in HUVECs and increased CD31, VEGFA, and EPO. These effects of Rosavin were abolished by HIF-1α inhibitor YC-1. Rosavin's interaction with the VHL protein instead of PHD2. Expression of HIF-1α and CD31 increased by Rosavin, which were failed after siVHL.\n\nCONCLUSION: Rosavin can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, improve neurological deficits, reduce cerebral infarct volume, and enhance spatial learning and memory abilities in MCAO/IR rats, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects. The underlying mechanism involves stabilizing HIF-1α protein through inhibiting VHL, increasing its nuclear translocation, which upregulates the expression of its target genes VEGF and EPO."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a significant global health issue that contributes to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Mitochondrial dysfunction in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) plays a crucial role in the progression of CKD. However, the involvement of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) methylation in hypertensive CKD and its potential as a therapeutic target remains largely unexamined.\n\nMETHODS: A hypertensive CKD mouse model was induced by continuous infusion of AngII (angiotensin II). Renal mtDNA methylation types and levels were evaluated using nanopore sequencing and dot blot assays. The impact of N\n\nRESULTS: Utilizing high-confidence Nanopore sequencing, we identified 6mA as the predominant methylation type in renal mtDNA, rather than 5-methylcytosine. In mice with hypertensive CKD, renal mtDNA 6mA levels significantly increased, while 5-methylcytosine levels remained stable. METTL4, the only known mammalian methyltransferase for 6mA, was upregulated in the renal tubules of hypertensive CKD mice and patients with hypertension. AngII stimulation increased METTL4 expression and mtDNA 6mA levels in primary TECs. Activated c-Jun/AP-1 (activator protein-1) directly promoted Mettl4 transcription in AngII-treated primary TECs. METTL4-catalyzed mtDNA 6mA impeded mitochondrial transcription initiation complex assembly, thereby halting mtDNA transcription, disrupting mitochondrial function, and resulting in the transition of TECs into a proinflammatory and profibrotic phenotype. TEC-specific\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that METTL4-catalyzed mtDNA 6mA contributes to renal mitochondrial dysfunction and hypertensive CKD, offering novel therapeutic strategies from the perspective of mitochondrial epigenetics."

    "text": "Renal dysfunction is common in patients with cancer and affects their pharmacokinetics, thereby altering treatment efficacy and safety. This review outlines the principles of dose adjustment based on renal function and highlights specific issues in patients undergoing dialysis or with proteinuria. In patients undergoing dialysis, dose adjustment can be rational if drug properties such as molecular weight and protein binding are considered. Metabolites of some drugs, such as fluorouracil (5-FU), may accumulate in patients with impaired renal function, thereby increasing the risk of toxicity. For oxaliplatin, increased platinum exposure in patients undergoing dialysis does not necessarily increase toxicity, possibly because reactive platinum species are eliminated independent of renal function. Proteinuria can lead to reduced drug exposure to monoclonal antibodies owing to abnormal urinary excretion. The early detection and management of drug-induced kidney injuries are essential. These strategies include identifying risk factors, adjusting doses, and implementing monitoring systems. Protocol-based approaches, such as pharmacist-led monitoring, can improve cancer pharmacotherapy. Automated systems and AI-based models have also been explored for risk prediction. Future studies should focus on deepening our understanding of pharmacokinetics in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) or those on dialysis. Multidisciplinary collaboration in onco-nephrology is important to improve cancer care in this growing population."

In this study, since gH-625 suffers from low proteolytic stability, we identified the main cleavage sites after incubation with the enzyme chymotrypsin, and l-amino acids at these sites were replaced with their d-enantiomers, which share similar physicochemical properties but have distinct biological roles. Four peptides, namely gH-w10, gH-l7, gH-y13, and gH-combi, were designed and synthesized. Their biosafety profiles were evaluated in both normal and cancer cell lines and no significant toxic effects were revealed at the tested concentrations. Subsequently, we assessed their cell-penetrating ability by evaluating cellular uptake through fluorescence microscopy and investigated their mechanism of action in a model system of liposomes, measuring fusogenic activity, peptide insertion into the lipid bilayer, and leakage activity. The impact of the d-amino acid substitution on secondary structure was explored by circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Finally, in vitro safety profiling data of the gH-625 and its most promising derivative gH-combi were further confirmed in vivo using a chicken embryo model."

Owing to the diminished levels of IgD in serum, IgD MM manifests as subtle M protein spikes in routine serum electrophoresis, rendering it susceptible to misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis. The objective of this study was to develop a machine learning (ML) model utilizing readily available complete blood count and biochemical test data for the purpose of screening IgD MM.\n\nMETHODS: This study encompassed clinical data from 83 newly diagnosed IgD MM patients and 166 non-IgD MM patients, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithms were employed for model construction. The predictive performance of the ML models was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curve analysis, and decision curve analysis.\n\nRESULTS: The random forest-based screening model demonstrated superior performance, incorporating seven key features: LDH, albumin, creatinine, Ca, β2 microglobulin, age and Hb. It achieved an AUC of 0.954 (95 % CI 0.930-0.977), with a sensitivity of 0.958, specificity of 0.747, positive predictive value of 88.3 % and negative predictive value of 89.9 %. Furthermore, this model has been evaluated in the validation cohort.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The model constructed based on the random forest algorithm demonstrates potential in screening IgD MM patients, particularly when routine IgD immunotyping testing is not conducted in clinical practice. This can assist clinicians in early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies, thereby optimizing the utilization of medical resources."

Recent researchs on the origin of PD underscored the significant role of genomic and proteomic approaches in examining molecular alterations in the brains. Specifically, the shifts in gene expression patterns asso-ciated with processes like neuroinflammation, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial impairments have been observed. Nevertheless, the intricate connections between aging and this neurodegenerative condition remain partially understood. Recognizing that pinpointing specific genes and pathways involved in this pro-cess could transform these discoveries into potential treatments, we have devised a network-based strategy to explore how baseline gene expression in brain tissues af-fected by PD evolves with age. For this purpose, data on genes and their expression levels were obtained from the Gene4PD and GTEx databases, allowing us to create distinct gene expression datasets for each brain tissue type across six age groups. In detail, we identified a set of genes exhibiting significant expression changes in certain tissues over time. Additionally, we constructed a related set of protein interaction networks corresponding based on these tissues and age groups. Results revealed six genes with age-dependent expression variations across four brain regions, suggesting their potential involvement in PD progression. Further findings suggest that both age and sex may impact the likelihood of developing PD, emphasizing the need for more studies to unravel the biological mechanisms that contribute to the increased risk of PD associated with aging."

However, the specific impact of lupenone on colon cancer has not been fully elucidated.\n\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this research was to explore the anti-cancer effects of lupenone monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy agents in colon cancer.\n\nMETHOD: In vitro study, the cytotoxic effects of lupenone on CT26 and MC38 colon cancer cells were examined using CCK8 assay and colony formation assay. The anti-proliferation properties of lupenone were assessed via Ki67 staining, while cell apoptosis was analyzed using flow cytometry. The anti-migratory effects of lupenone were also detected using scratch wound healing assay and transwell assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways were measured using live-cell probes and real-time PCR, respectively. Autophagy and autophagy flux were evaluated through western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. In vivo experiment, the anti-tumor effects of lupenone, both as a monotherapy and in combination with cisplatin, were further examined in a CT26 tumor-bearing mouse model. Tumor volume and protein expression were used to evaluate anti-tumor efficacy, while histological staining assessed the safety of lupenone. RNA sequencing was performed to clarify the mechanisms of the combination of lupenone and cisplatin.\n\nRESULTS: Lupenone significantly inhibited the growth of CT26 and MC38 colon cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner, reducing cell proliferation and migration while promoting apoptosis. lupenone increased ROS levels and induced ROS-dependent ER stress in colon cancer cells. Additionally, lupenone triggered autophagy and inhibited autophagy flux, exerting anti-colon cancer effects that were attenuated by the autophagy inhibitor 3MA. Molecular docking revealed that lupenone has the potential to bind to mTOR, and the mTOR activator MHY1485 partially reversed lupenone-induced autophagy. Additionally, the scavenging of ROS and the inhibition of ER stress partially reversed the autophagic effects of lupenone. In vivo studies revealed that lupenone suppressed subcutaneous tumor growth without causing significant weight loss or damage to major organs. The combination therapy with lupenone and cisplatin enhanced anti-tumor efficacy, with RNA sequencing analyses indicating regulation of cancer cell metabolism, T cell differentiation and activation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and the immune-inflammatory microenvironment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated lupenone monotherapy inhibited the growth of colon canceris and was non-toxic to major organs, while the combination of lupenone and chemotherapy drug could enhance the anti-cancer efficacy of chemotherapy drug. These findings highlight the potential of lupenone as a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of colon cancer."

    "text": "Intravascular hemolysis is a common event in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases with heterogeneous etiologies and clinical features. A frequent adverse effect of massive hemolysis is kidney injury, which is a major cause of increased morbidity and mortality in chronic hemolytic diseases. However, the role of crosstalk between red blood cell-derived microparticles (RMPs) and endothelial cells (ECs) in hemolysis remains unknown, especially in hemolysis-mediated kidney injury. To answer this question, we established an in vitro co-incubation model of hemolysis-derived RMPs and ECs as well as a mouse model intravenously injected with hemolytic RMPs. We found that a large number of internalized RMPs contributed to the ferroptosis of ECs via iron overload, amino acid metabolism disorder, and the miR-130a/ACSL4 axis. Furthermore, RMPs-induced endothelial ferroptosis could enhance oxidative stress, aggravate histopathological damage, and promote loss of renal function in mice. These pathological effects were significantly ameliorated in mice treated with ferroptosis inhibitors ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) and deferoxamine (DFO). In conclusion, our study demonstrated that RMPs-induced ferroptosis of ECs plays an important role in the development and progression of kidney damage associated with hemolysis, and inhibition of ferroptosis may be a potential therapeutic approach to prevent renal injury in patients with severe hemolytic crisis."

However, the underlying mechanism related to renal fibrosis remains not fully understood.\n\nPURPOSE: The aim of this study was to elucidate the protective effects and mechanism of FPS against renal fibrosis with a focus on gut-kidney axis.\n\nMETHODS: We established renal fibrosis models in mice using unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), folic acid (FA) challenge, or a microbiota-depleted, with continuous oral administration of FPS, Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK), or acetate at specified doses and intervals. Simultaneously, we examined the impact of FPS on epithelial mesenchymal transformation in cultured HK-2 and investigated the associated mechanisms.\n\nRESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate that fucoidan administration reduces renal collagen deposition, inflammation, epithelial mesenchymal transformation and improves renal function in mouse models of renal fibrosis induced by UUO or FA. Metagenomics analysis showed that fucoidan significantly increases the abundance of AKK by promoting its growth in UUO-induced renal fibrosis. Oral administration of live AKK alleviates renal fibrosis in UUO and FA mouse models. Using oral antibiotic-treated mice, we found that the effect of fucoidan on renal fibrosis was weakened. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) study results show that AKK produces the short-chain fatty acids (acetate), which protects against renal fibrosis by suppressing NEU1-TLR4-NFκB-mediated inflammation in the kidney.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our findings establish a novel gut-kidney axis wherein fucoidan ameliorates renal fibrosis through AKK-mediated acetate production and subsequent NEU1-TLR4-NFκB pathway inhibition."

In this study, we identify a critical interface between distal Ig domains that enables NOMO to maintain ER morphology and bear mechanical forces. By incorporating two independent tension sensors in the luminal domain of NOMO, we demonstrate that NOMO assemblies experience forces in the single piconewton range, with a significant contribution from the identified interface. These newly defined features are important-if not indispensable-for myogenesis, as interface mutations affecting mechanosensitivity fail to restore the essential role of NOMO during myogenesis in a C2C12 differentiation model.

Complementing this approach, advancements in techniques for evaluating lean muscle mass, such as dual-energy biomarkers and computed tomography (CT), have improved the accuracy of muscle mass determination. When conducted by experienced practitioners, ultrasound offers a fast, reliable, and reproducible method for assessing muscle mass. Additionally, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) has benefited from technological and methodological improvements, allowing the use of body cell mass as a guide for protein administration. Energy expenditure is most accurately measured using indirect calorimetry, which should be performed regularly due to day-to-day fluctuations and prevent the risks of overfeeding or underfeeding.\n\nSUMMARY: All these progresses are paving the way to precision nutrition in intensive care, determining more accurately the energy needs and adapting the macronutrient administration according to body composition and not anymore by kilogram weight."

While initially investigated in the context of oncogenesis, recent studies have just indicated its importance to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) like cardiac myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure (HF). This review focuses on therapeutic targets, regulatory mechanisms and signaling crosstalk between Hippo YAP/TAZ pathway with other traditional pathways like PI3K/AKT, TGF-β, WNT/β-catenin in CVD. Thus, although targeted YAP/TAZ activation in the myocardium may enhance regeneration/differentiation, its dysregulation promotes maladaptive cardiac remodeling characterized by hypertrophy and fibrosis. A better appreciation of the nuanced control on YAP/TAZ in different cardiovascular indications may point to an opportunity for precision therapeutics. In this review, we have discussed strategies to target specific components of the Hippo pathway as potential therapeutic approaches with implications for fibrosis reduction by LATS1/2 inhibition or cardiomyocyte survival promotion via MST1/2 suppression. The role of noncoding RNAs in YAP/TAZ activity modulation is further illustrated and provides us with possible therapeutic avenues that can be explored for noninvasive treatments."

ESRD is most often addressed by hemodialysis treatment, however, clinically significant interactions can occur between blood components, the dialysis membranes and the entire dialysis circuit. Zwitterionic compounds, such as polycarboxybetaine (PCB), are known for their ability to prevent blood protein adsorption and reduce platelet and complement activation. We synthesized and characterized two carboxybetaine (CB)-based copolymers tailored for coating the tubing and dialyzer components of the extracorporeal circuit. Utilizing both UV irradiation immobilization and a hydrophobic self-attachment technique, we successfully coated the tubing and dialyzer surfaces, respectively, with these zwitterionic copolymers. In vitro testing involved subjecting freshly drawn whole human blood through both, coated and uncoated circuits, under simulated hemodialysis circuit conditions. After one hour of continuous blood circulation and circuit contact, we assessed platelet and complement activation levels. Our results demonstrate significantly reduced platelet and complement activation and protein fouling on the zwitterionic-coated circuits compared to uncoated counterparts, indicating improved blood compatibility. This research underscores the potential of zwitterionic coatings as a promising approach to mitigate the need for continuous anticoagulation in hemodialysis treatment. By enhancing the blood compatibility of extracorporeal circuits, these coatings offer a safer and more effective solution for patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis.

In this study, we aimed to explore the role of mitochondrial dysfunction-related genetic variations in determining the natural age at menopause (ANM) by applying both Mendelian randomization (MR) and summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) approaches, complemented by experimental validation in animal models.\n\nMETHODS: Summary statistics on ANM, gene expression, DNA methylation, and protein abundance quantitative trait loci (eQTL, mQTL, pQTL) were obtained from public databases. Genetic variations associated with mitochondrial dysfunction were selected as instrumental variables, and SMR analysis was performed to investigate causal relationships with ANM. MR methods were also used to evaluate the causal effect of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) on ANM, with preliminary validation through animal experiments.\n\nRESULTS: SMR and meta-analysis results identified NSUN4 as a critical regulator of ANM at both the gene expression and DNA methylation levels. A preliminary causal relationship between reduced mtDNA-CN and increased ANM risk was found, though further validation with larger datasets is needed. Animal experiments indicated that NSUN4 levels in blood reflect ovarian function decline and may correlate with its expression in ovarian tissue.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that NUSN4 levels detected in the blood could serve as a potential biomarker for ovarian aging. This provides new insights into the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in reproductive age-related traits and may inform future targeted interventions to slow ovarian aging."

Therefore, we measured well-established redox biomarkers in plasma from young healthy volunteers before and after exhaustive exercise. We found that aerobic capacity, as measured by the level of VO"

    "text": "Sclerostin (Sost) functions as an inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is known to promote kidney cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and fibrosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the renoprotective effects of Sost in kidney diseases and its therapeutic potential as a target remain unknown. To clarify the protective role of Sost in CKD kidneys, we utilized ultrasound microbubble-mediated renal in situ gene transfection to overexpress and knockdown Sost in kidney. Subsequently, we employed the TurboID-based protein interaction technique to screen for Sost-binding proteins and combined it with ECAR/OCR to elucidate the regulation of glycolytic pathways by Sost and its binding proteins. Sost is predominantly expressed in renal tubules and that its expression is significantly diminished in renal tissues of CKD patients, as well as in UUO and folic acid (FA) induced CKD mouse. Overexpression of Sost in vivo and in vitro ameliorated tubular injury and fibrosis. Employing the TurboID technique, we uncovered an interaction between Sost and the potential glycolysis-associated protein Isg20, an interferon-stimulated ribonuclease. This binding interaction serves to inhibit Isg20-mediated aerobic glycolysis and subsequent fibrosis within the kidney of CKD. For Sost agonists screening, we found that HDG exerts salient anti-fibrotic and renal protective effects in CKD, which are likely attributable to its significant upregulation of Sost expression, thereby inhibiting Isg20-mediated glycolysis. In summary, we demonstrate that upregulation of Sost by HDG inhibits glycolysis and renal fibrosis in CKD through binding and suppressing of Isg20, and targeting Sost may develop novel approaches to treat CKD."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Ventral incisional hernias are a common surgical challenge, particularly when incarcerated, necessitating emergent laparotomy to prevent bowel ischemia and necrosis. The optimal approach for abdominal wall closure in these cases remains debated, with primary repair associated with greater recurrence rates and mesh reinforcement raising concerns regarding infection risks. This study aimed to compare the efficacy, safety, and recurrence rates of mesh-reinforced compared with primary closure during emergent laparotomy for incarcerated ventral incisional hernia.\n\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 149 patients who underwent emergent laparotomy for incarcerated ventral incisional hernia at a tertiary center from 2010 to 2020. Patients were categorized into a mesh-repair group (n = 78, 54.5%) and a primary repair group (n = 65, 45.5%). Data included demographics, laboratory values, operative details, and 30-day postoperative outcomes. Propensity score weighting was applied to balance key covariates including age, body mass index, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory values, bowel resection, wound classification, and complication severity.\n\nRESULTS: Patients in the mesh-repair group were younger (61 vs 69 years old; P = .003) and had significantly lower inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein: 0.8 vs 1.5 mg/dL, P = .006). Bowel resection was more frequent in the primary repair group (31% vs 0%, P < .001). No significant differences were found in operative time (P = .14) or major complications (P = .4). Hernia recurrence was significantly lower in the mesh repair group (22% vs 44%, P = .01). After propensity score weighting, recurrence remained significantly lower with mesh (15% vs 39%; P = .002). Subgroup analysis showed no additional benefit in recurrence reduction from retro-muscular mesh placement despite increased operative time.\n\nCONCLUSION: Mesh-reinforcement during emergent laparotomy for incarcerated ventral incisional hernia is associated with a significantly lower rate of hernia recurrence compared with primary closure. Mesh-reinforced repair demonstrated comparable postoperative morbidity, including rates of major complications, when carefully selected patients were treated. Although this study provides valuable insights into emergent ventral incisional hernia repair strategies, the high recurrence rate in the mesh group raises questions regarding the long-term efficacy of mesh reinforcement in emergent settings."

Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms involved remain unidentified. The present study aimed to identify the involvement of EMT‑related genes in the advancement of DN. Using the Gene Expression Omnibus database and the dbEMT 2.0 database, EMT‑related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with DN were identified. Key EMT‑related genes were subjected to weighted gene co‑expression network analysis, machine learning and protein‑protein interaction network analyses and validated against validation datasets from GEO database. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to assess the diagnostic performance of these hub genes. To delve into their cellular clustering in DN, single‑nucleus RNA sequencing was conducted using the Kidney Integrative Transcriptomics database. Additionally, the CIBERSORT algorithm was used to determine the proportion of immune cell infiltration in DN samples. Reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR) was used to assess the mRNA expression of fibronectin 1 (FN1) in the kidney of mice and patients with DN. After silencing FN1, the expression changes of EMT markers (E‑cadherin and vimentin) were detected by RT‑qPCR. FN1 was upregulated in DN, demonstrating good diagnostic performance according to ROC analysis. FN1 was associated with infiltration of immune cells. RT‑qPCR confirmed the increased expression of FN1 in the kidney of mice with DN and in the renal biopsy samples of patients with DN. After silencing FN1, the expression of E‑cadherin was upregulated, while the expression of vimentin was downregulated, indicating that EMT was inhibited. The present study identified FN1 as a diagnostic marker for DN. FN1 may serve key roles in the initiation and progression of DN by participating in EMT and upregulating various types of immune cells."

We therefore evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers, specifically Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6), surfactant protein A (SP-A), and surfactant protein D (SP-D), in distinguishing fibrotic ILDs from healthy individuals or non-fibrotic respiratory conditions.\n\nMETHODS: A systematic review and bivariate random-effects meta-analysis were conducted, comparing serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of KL-6, SP-A, or SP-D against histopathology or high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, and heterogeneity (I\n\nRESULTS: Nineteen studies involving 3,320 participants were included.

Subgroup analysis showed significantly reduced diagnostic performance in autoimmune-associated ILDs versus idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (e.g., KL-6 specificity 0.87 vs. 0.98; P = 0.015).\n\nCONCLUSION: KL-6 and SP-A demonstrated high specificity and moderate sensitivity, supporting their use to rule in fibrotic ILDs. Diagnostic accuracy was lower in autoimmune interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), suggesting that tailored thresholds or combined testing may be necessary."

This review explores strategies for metabolic assessment and tailored nutritional interventions and their impact on weaning outcomes, highlighting individualized nutritional interventions. While indirect calorimetry provides direct metabolic data, diaphragm ultrasound can complement metabolic monitoring by assessing respiratory muscle function and detecting early signs of muscle wasting. Protein intake in critically ill patients remains controversial, as early high protein administration (greater than 1.2 g/kg each day) has not demonstrated clear benefits and may even be detrimental to successful ventilator weaning, supporting the adoption of a moderate, individualized nutritional strategy. Vitamin D deficiency is common in critically ill patients, and targeted supplementation may reduce mechanical ventilation duration. High-fat and ketogenic diets have shown limited benefit and are not currently recommended. Some nutritional supplements ( e.g. , creatine, branched-chain amino acids, β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate) are under investigation, but current evidence does not support their routine use. A personalized approach integrating metabolic assessment, tailored protein intake, and vitamin D optimization may improve weaning success, functional recovery, and post-intensive care unit outcomes. Further research is needed to refine evidence-based guidelines."

    "text": "Recent studies highlight the role of skeletal muscle wasting in the sepsis-associated long-term mortality. Despite clinical recommendations for increased protein intake to counteract muscle wasting, the outcomes have been suboptimal, suggesting that anabolic resistance should be considered in addition to nutritional support. Emerging evidence suggests that impaired mitophagy hampers anabolic processes in skeletal muscle, exacerbating muscle wasting in sepsis. Furthermore, thyroid hormone (TH), which is essential for both anabolism and mitophagy, is locally inactivated by type 3 Deiodinase (Dio3) at the onset of sepsis, potentially disrupting mitophagy and contributing to anabolic resistance. Here we demonstrate that local hypothyroidism is a key factor impairing mitophagy in skeletal muscle during early sepsis, leading to metabolic disturbances and muscle wasting. Dio3 knockdown preserves muscle mass, and ameliorates metabolic dysfunction via mitophagy promotion in sepsis models. Mechanistically, the knockdown of Dio3 triggers an upregulation of NRK2, facilitating the restoration of NAD salvage synthesis. This enhancement of NAD levels subsequently activates Sirtuins deacetylase, which in turn decreases PINK1 acetylation, preventing its proteolytic processing by OMA1. Therefore, targeting Dio3 offers a promising therapeutic approach to counteract sepsis-induced muscle wasting."

The present study aimed to examine the effect of sleep quality and oral immunity on postcompetition infection risk in young swimmers participating in a national swimming event.\n\nMETHODS: Nineteen voluntary adolescent swimmers from a high school were enrolled. Hooper questionnaire, saliva samples, and sleep quality collected on the fifth day before the competition were recorded as baseline data, and saliva and sleep data on the day of the competition, collected before its start, were used as study data. The levels of salivary total protein (TP), α-amylase, salivary immunoglobulin A, lactoferrin, interleukin-6, and cortisol were measured, and athletes' sleep quality was also monitored.\n\nRESULTS: Compared with baseline, the Hooper Index indicated a significant decrease in sleep quality and an increase in stress level before the competition. Levels of α-amylase/TP, salivary immunoglobulin A/TP, and lactoferrin/TP significantly decreased on the morning of the competition, whereas interleukin-6 and cortisol levels showed a significant increase. Analysis of sleep variables in relation to postcompetition infections revealed a significant negative correlation between sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and the number of postcompetition medical visits.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the overall physiological factors contributing to the decline in athletes' salivary levels of α-amylase/TP, salivary immunoglobulin A/TP, and lactoferrin/TP and increased susceptibility to infections after competition may be related to sleep quality on the night before the competition."

Phytochemicals, with their diverse impacts on cancer cell growth and metabolism, represent promising candidates for such strategies. Combining compounds like curcumin (Curc) and ursolic acid (UA), which target multiple pathways, can be advantageous in slowing tumor progression. Previous studies revealed the synergistic effects of Curc + UA in reducing tumor growth in a PCa allograft model. In this study, diet-based interventions were evaluated using two transgenic mouse models of PCa. Mice fed a Curc + UA-enriched diet exhibited significant inhibition of prostate tumor progression compared to single-agent diets in both HiMyc and PTEN knockout mouse models. Protein analyses of ventral prostate tissues from HiMyc mice indicated that the combination suppressed oncogenic signaling pathways, including STAT3, AKT, and mTORC1, while modulating cell regulatory proteins to inhibit tumor cell proliferation. Furthert mechanistic studies in mouse and human PCa cell lines confirmed that Curc + UA exerted pleiotropic effects by influencing oncogenic signaling, cell cycle regulation, mitochondrial function, unfolded protein response (UPR), and apoptosis, collectively contributing to its synergistic efficacy. These findings highlight the potential of Curc + UA to inhibit PCa progression through multitargeted mechanisms. The combination's superior efficacy over single agents underscores its promise as a chemopreventive or therapeutic strategy. This study provides a strong rationale for further mechanistic investigations and clinical development of Curc + UA for PCa prevention and treatment."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) severity is essential for clinical management and outcome prediction. Traditional tools, like the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale for head injuries (MAIS/Head), have limitations, particularly in cases involving sedation, complex injuries, or diffuse brain injuries. This study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of plasma and salivary S100B levels as biomarkers for TBI severity, based on GCS and MAIS/Head, with emphasis on emergency settings.\n\nMETHODS: Multicenter prospective cohort study enrolled 57 adult patients with blunt TBI. TBI severity was assessed using GCS and MAIS/Head. Plasma and salivary S100B samples were collected 2-4h post-injury and measured via ELISA. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves assessed S100B's discriminative capacity for TBI severity.\n\nRESULTS: Plasma and salivary S100B concentrations were higher in moderate and severe TBI cases. ROC analysis revealed strong discriminative performance for plasma (AUC = 0.87 and 0.83) and salivary S100B (AUC = 0.85 and 0.83), for GCS and MAIS/HEAD, respectively. Salivary S100B showed 100 % specificity for mild TBI and 100 % sensitivity for moderate TBI (MAIS/Head). Plasma S100B exhibited 100 % sensitivity for severe TBI (GCS ≤8). Both biomarkers did not distinguish between moderate and severe injuries.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Plasma and salivary S100B levels effectively discriminate mild from severe TBI, complementing current clinical severity scales. Their use may support rapid decision-making in emergency departments, especially given the simplicity, non-invasiveness, and feasibility of salivary sampling. These findings support integrating S100B measurement into TBI management protocols to enhance clinical accuracy and patient outcomes."

However, the accurate computational prediction of ACP remains challenging because of the complex molecular mechanisms underlying cancer. In this study, we introduce EnsemPred-ACP, an innovative ensemble framework that combines machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches to enhance ACP prediction. Our primary innovation is the introduction of binary profile features (BPF) to augment pre-trained protein embeddings, thereby capturing position-specific patterns crucial for ACP identification. The framework used a dual-pipeline architecture; ML models processed handcrafted sequence features and embeddings, whereas DL models handled BPF-enhanced embeddings. Upon evaluation with independent datasets, EnsemPred-ACP achieved an accuracy of 0.863, sensitivity of 0.897, and specificity of 0.830, notably outperforming existing methods. The model demonstrated a strong generalisation performance, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93. Ablation studies on independent datasets further highlighted the substantial impact of BPF, enhancing the prediction accuracy by 2.5 % and 11.1 % when integrated with ESM2 and ProtT5 embeddings, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our integrated approach in accurately identifying potential therapeutic peptides, thereby contributing to the advancement of peptide-based cancer therapeutics."

However, all of the previous studies have predominantly focused on isoform 1 (the full-length form), which consists of 566 amino acids. Here, we show that a shorter isoform, which is 308 amino acids lacking most of the N-terminus (human isoform 4; mouse isoform 3; ΔN-RNF220), is the predominant and ubiquitously expressed variant that warrants functional investigation. Both isoform 1 and ΔN-RNF220 are expressed in the brain; however, ΔN-RNF220 is the major isoform expressed in all other tissues in mice. Consistently, H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data from ENCODE reveal that the transcription start site for ΔN-RNF220 demonstrates broader and stronger activity across human tissues than that of isoform 1. ΔN-RNF220 produces 2 peptides (4a and 4b) through alternative translation initiation, with isoform 4b displaying distinct subcellular localization, subnuclear structures and interaction with a nuclear protein WDR5. Notably, during embryonic stem cell differentiation into neural stem cells, isoform 1 expression increases, whereas ΔN-RNF220 expression decreases. In murine myoblasts, ΔN-RNF220 is the sole expressed isoform and is required for MyoD and myogenin expression, as well as for muscle differentiation. Our findings highlight ΔN-RNF220 as the ubiquitously and highly expressed variant, likely playing a fundamental role across tissues while exhibiting functional differences from isoform 1. These results emphasize the critical importance of ΔN-RNF220 in future studies investigating the biological functions of RNF220."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia (PED) is a rare movement disorder characterized by choreoathetosis and dystonia triggered by sustained exercise, commonly affecting the lower extremities. PED is an autosomal dominant disorder genetically linked to mutations in the SLC2A1 gene. The transmembrane protein Glut1, encoded by the SLC2A1 gene, can transport glucose from blood to the brain. This study aimed to characterize the genetic and clinical features of SLC2A1-related PED.\n\nMETHODS: We reported two Chinese PED families presenting with involuntary movements after prolonged exercise. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on two probands, and cosegregation analysis was subsequently carried out in available family members. Additionally, we summarized and analyzed the genetic and clinical features of SLC2A1-related PED by retrieving information from the literature.\n\nRESULTS: Genetic testing identified two missense mutations in SLC2A1 in these families, including a known disease-causing mutation, c.997C>T (p.R333W), and a novel mutation, c.823G>C (p.A275P). Upon review of the literature, mutations in certain regions of the Glut1 protein, particularly in transmembrane segments 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8, together with the intracellular domain, were more frequently seen in PED. Among the various types of epilepsy, absence seizures were the most common in patients with PED. Furthermore, familial PED had a later onset and a higher cerebrospinal fluid/blood glucose ratio. Patients with missense mutations exhibited a later onset than those with truncated mutations.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study identified a new disease-causing mutation and, through an extensive literature review, provided a detailed genetic and clinical description of PED associated with SLC2A1 mutations."

However, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which possess great potential for collagen substitute, are still a challenge for use in bone graft due to its cytotoxicity. Furthermore, biomineralization of bone-like HAp crystals with hierarchical structure and excellent mechanical strength induced by CNTs remains challenging. Herein, inspired by the hierarchical structure of natural bone, CNTs/HAp hybrid composites are successfully mediated by lysozyme aggregates through biomineralization. Abundant functional groups on the lysozyme aggregates-coated CNTs enrich the interface with bonded calcium and phosphate ions, facilitating the nucleation and growth of HAp crystals with c-axis orientation being similar to bone-like crystals. Owing to the adhesion originated from biofilm, lysozyme aggregates could readily integrate HAp on CNTs surface with excellent bonding stability under external pulling force, supporting attachment and proliferation of cells and bone tissues. Therefore, this biocompatible and biomimetic composites with osteoconductivity holds potential application on bone repair surgery and synthetic bone graft substitutes."

To train an AI model, however, a large dataset is typically required, especially when using the most powerful techniques. Therefore, not all specialties are taking advantage of AI techniques in the same way. For instance, they are seldomly used in areas such as the diagnosis of rare diseases since, due to their low prevalence, not enough data are typically available to train an AI model. In this paper, we address the use of AI techniques to diagnose a particular rare disease: Collagen VI-related Congenital Muscular Dystrophy from confocal microscopy images. We apply both classical machine learning and modern deep learning techniques and we show that, when using the appropriate data management and training procedures, one can successfully derive a highly-accurate classifier even with a limited amount of training data. Due to the generality of the explored techniques, this conclusion is likely to hold also for most of the rare diseases whose diagnosis relies on the examination of histological images."

These models have shown immense potential in biomedical applications, including drug discovery, protein design, and understanding disease mechanisms at the molecular level. However, PLMs are typically pre-trained on residue sequences alone, with limited incorporation of structural information, presenting opportunities for further enhancement. In this paper, we propose Structure Information Injecting Tuning (SI-Tuning), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to integrate structural information into PLMs. SI-Tuning maintains the original model parameters in a frozen state while optimizing task-specific vectors for input embedding and attention maps. Structural features, including dihedral angles and distance maps, are used to derive this vector, injecting the structural information that improves model performance in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on 650M ESM-2 demonstrate the effectiveness of our SI-Tuning across multiple downstream tasks. Specifically, our SI-Tuning achieves an accuracy of 93.95% on DeepLoc binary classification, and 76.05% on Metal Ion Binding, outperforming SaProt, a large-scale pre-trained PLM with structural modeling. SI-Tuning effectively enhances the performance of PLMs by incorporating structural information in a parameter-efficient manner. Our method not only advances downstream task performance, but also offers significant computational efficiency, making it a valuable strategy for applying large-scale PLM to broad biomedical downstream applications.

We applied an integrative strategy combining phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), Mendelian randomization (MR), network toxicology, and molecular docking to systematically evaluate potential adverse effects of AT. PheWAS analyses were performed across 784 phenotypes using UK Biobank and FinnGen (R10). Among these, loss-of-function mutations in AT targets SLC6A2 and SLC6A4 showed significant associations after multiple-testing correction with pancreatic cancer and erythematous conditions, respectively. Complementary MR analyses using GTEx v8 tissue-specific cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and multiple autoimmune and inflammatory genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets demonstrated that elevated expression of SLC6A2 and SLC6A4 conferred protective effects against systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, rosacea, and erythema nodosum across tissues, supporting the causal relevance of these pathways. Network toxicology based on protein-protein interactions (STRING v11.5, Cytoscape v3.10.1) and functional enrichment (ClusterProfiler v4.10.0) highlighted immunoinflammatory, neuroendocrine, and ion channel regulatory mechanisms potentially involved in AT-induced toxicity. Finally, molecular docking simulations (AutoDock Vina v1.2.7, AlphaFold structures) provided structural evidence for AT interactions with key targets including TRPV1. Collectively, these findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition or environmental accumulation of AT may contribute to inflammatory skin reactions and pancreatic tumorigenesis through multiple converging molecular pathways."

In this study, we developed an efficient method to overexpress recombinant HD5 in Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21 (DE3) strain by using calmodulin (CaM), which also interacts with antimicrobial peptides, as a fusion partner. Fusion expression suppressed the degradation of HD5 and reduced its toxicity to host cells. Following purification of the fusion protein and enzymatic cleavage to release the HD5 region, we successfully obtained sufficient amounts (yielding 1.5-1.7 mg/L culture) of active recombinant HD5oxi and HD5red for various applications, including stable isotope-labeled peptides for NMR analysis. Furthermore, we investigated the protective effect of CaM fusion and the mechanism of disulfide bond formation using CD and NMR spectroscopy, structural prediction, and molecular dynamics simulations. Our results suggest that the appropriate interaction strength between CaM and the HD5 region in the fusion state is a key factor for stable production."

Presently, there are no disease-specific treatments approved for these disorders, although there is much interest in the therapeutic potential of complement inhibition. However, the limited duration and necessarily small size of controlled trials means there is a need to quantify how well short-term changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria predict the clinically important outcome of kidney failure.\n\nMETHODS: We address this using longitudinal data from the UK Registry of Rare Kidney Diseases (RaDaR) involving retrospective and prospective data collection with linkage to hospital laboratories via automated feeds of 371 patients. Analyses of kidney survival were conducted using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression with eGFR slope estimated using linear mixed models.\n\nRESULTS: In a median of 11.0 (inter quartile range 7.4-15.1) years follow-up, 148 patients (40%) reached kidney failure. There was no significant difference in progression to kidney failure between C3G and IC-MPGN groups. Baseline urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR), although high, was not associated with kidney failure in either group. Two-year eGFR slope had a modest association with kidney failure. In contrast, both 20%‒50% and 50 mg/mmol reductions in UPCR between 0-12 months were associated with lower kidney failure risk in both groups. Notably, those with a UPCR under 100 mg/mmol at 12 months had a substantially lower risk of kidney failure (hazard ratio 0.10 (95% confidence interval 0.03-0.30).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, proteinuria a short time after diagnosis is strongly associated with long-term outcomes and a UPCR under 100 mg/mmol at one year is associated with a substantially lower kidney failure risk."

The present study aimed to assess in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetics of akuamma alkaloids using a sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS)-based bioanalytical method. The method was found to be simple, sensitive, and rapid, effectively evaluating absorption, distribution, metabolism, and oral/intravenous pharmacokinetics in male Sprague-Dawley rats. These alkaloids demonstrated high permeability using human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell monolayers. Akuammine and akuammiline showed half-lives of 13.5 and 30.3 min in reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-supplemented rat liver microsomes. Pseudo-akuammigine showed the highest plasma protein binding, followed by the other alkaloids. Oral dosing of the ground seed suspension revealed significant systemic exposure of only akuammine, with low oral bioavailability. This research is the first comprehensive report on the ADME properties and pharmacokinetics of akuamma alkaloids, providing critical insights for developing these compounds as potential phytotherapeutic agents for pain management or other medicinal uses."

Here, our study identified endogenous hepcidin was induced with increasing severity of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury mostly in collecting duct (CD) principal and intercalated cells.\n\nMETHODS: We employed RNA sequencing, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and gene knockdown and knockin technologies to define the role of hepcidin during I/R-induced kidney injury.\n\nRESULTS: Mechanically, RNA seq revealed hepcidin protected M-1 cells (murine cortical CD cell line) against ferroptosis following hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry identified hepcidin interacting with lactoferrin, consequently preserving the expression of lactoferrin following H/R which mediated the protective effect of hepcidin. Correspondingly, lactoferrin knockdown reduced the anti-ferroptotic effect of hepcidin in M-1 cells exposed to H/R revealing a novel function of hepcidin independent of the iron transporter ferroportin. In vivo, utilizing CD-specific hepcidin-knockin (HepcidinKspKI) and CD-specific hepcidin-knockdown mice (Adeno Associated Virus-Hep), we found that endogenous hepcidin protected against CD ferroptosis by preserving lactoferrin which consequently mitigated ischemic kidney injury and dysfunction, remarkedly improving the survival rate. Finally, recombinant hepcidin administration exhibited a comparable protective effect, albeit with less efficacy in reducing the mortality rate compared to conditional knockin of CD hepcidin.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our study identified an endogenous protective mechanism of injured CD cells via a hepcidin/lactoferrin/ferroptosis axis which may suggest a novel pharmacologic therapeutic for ischemic AKI."

Herein, we aimed to investigate their relationship in drug-naïve SCZ from a novel perspective.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 228 drug-naïve SCZ, divided into pre-MetS and non-pre-MetS groups. Blood samples were collected to measure the markers, including fasting plasma glucose (FPG), cholesterol (CHO), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), C-reactive protein (CRP), CRP-albumin ratio (CAR), and neutrophils-lymphocytes ratio (NLR). MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) was used to assess cognitive function. Partial correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between the markers and cognitive function.\n\nRESULTS: Patients with pre-MetS exhibited significant differences from those in the non- pre-MetS group on five dimensions of cognitive function (P < 0.05). In the pre-MetS group, FPG, TG, HDL and NLR were all significantly correlated with cognitive function (P < 0.05), and the combined HDL and NLR showed good performance in identifying cognitive impairment with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.712. In the non-pre-MetS group, CRP and CAR were significantly correlated with cognitive function (P < 0.05), and the combination of CRP and CAR had a better ability to identify cognitive impairment (AUC = 0.744).\n\nCONCLUSION: Patients with pre-MetS have more cognitive impairment. These findings provide insights into the different mechanisms by which inflammation is involved in the process of cognitive impairment in SCZ with and without pre-MetS."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (SBG) is traditionally used to prevent miscarriage through its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic effects. However, its mechanisms in early-stage abortion (ESA) remain unclear.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A novel network pharmacology workflow was developed to identify bioactive compounds in SBG, including the nontargeted detection of SBG components, extraction of compounds from the HERB database, manual screening and filtering. These compounds were confirmed via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Targets associated with bioactive compounds were enriched via the SWISS database, and disease-related targets were identified via GeneCards. Overlapping targets were analyzed to construct a protein - protein interaction (PPI) network, with interactions predicted via STRING and visualized via Cytoscape. Molecular docking, dynamic simulations, and transcriptomics were used to prioritize key bioactive compounds. Two ESA models were used to evaluate therapeutic effects: one induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the other by mifepristone (Ru486). Decidual histopathology was observed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and hematoxylin - eosin (HE) staining. Key targets and pathways were validated through network pharmacology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), Western blotting (WB), and ELISA. Finally, the effects of SBG on pregnancy maintenance were investigated by modulating the HIF-1α pathway, with a focus on its impact on critical biomarkers identified through the screening process.\n\nRESULTS: Compared with RU486, SBG demonstrated greater efficacy in treating LPS-induced ESAs, as evidenced by lower embryo absorption rates, fewer miscarriages, and milder decidual pathological changes. Through multilevel screening, we identified 10 compounds in SBG with the highest drug potential, which were confirmed in the original plant. These compounds are predicted to specifically modulate LPS-ESA through 38 targets, influencing 525 biological processes and 126 signaling pathways. Integrated pharmacological analysis highlighted the HIF-1α signaling pathway as the key mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of SBG on ESAs. Experiments involving HIF-1α pathway activation and inhibition confirmed that SBG inhibits decidual and embryonic cell apoptosis and hypoxia by blocking HIF-1α signal transmission.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study established a rigorous framework for screening and analyzing the therapeutic components of SBG and revealed that SBG is specifically effective against ESAs and maternal-fetal interface inflammation through the HIF-1α signaling pathway. These findings highlight SBG as a therapeutic agent for ESA and provide a foundation for future mechanistic studies."

This study aimed to comprehensively assess the associations of toxicants with gout and to investigate the mediated mechanisms. This cross-sectional study included 22,591 adults diagnosed with gout in the NHANES 2011-2018. Twenty-one toxicants in 5 categories were detected in the blood, including acrylamide, ethylene oxide, metals, nicotine metabolites, and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations of toxicant exposures with gout risk. Moreover, this study performed enrichment analysis and protein network analysis to identify potential hub targets of toxicants. Among the 22,591 participants aged 49.8 ± 17.8 years and 1082 (4.8 %) were diagnosed with gout. In the weighted logistic regression, Cu, Pb, Hg, and PFNA were positively associated with gout risk. The E-R curves revealed the linear relationships of Cu, Pb, Hg, and PFNA with gout risk without a safe threshold. Significant mediating effects of liver function, eGFR, and OBS were observed in the relationships of Cu, Pb, and Hg with gout risk. Moreover, network toxicology analyses revealed that TNF and AKT1 are shared hub targets of Cu, Pb, Hg, and PFNA. Our study indicated that elevated oxidative levels and decreased liver and kidney functions posed a crucial mediating effect on the associations between toxicants and gout risk. TNF and PI3K-Akt signalling pathways may be shared mechanisms of the adverse effects of toxicants on gout."

No data are available regarding the evolutive characteristics of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in individuals living in French Polynesia.\n\nMETHODS: We aimed to compare the retrospectively collected characteristics and outcomes of 92 and 63 individuals from French Polynesia and mainland France, respectively, presenting type 2 diabetes and biopsy-confirmed DKD, focusing on kidney survival, analysis of the Renal Pathology Society (RPS) score and participant survival.\n\nRESULTS: At the time of biopsy, Polynesian participants were younger (56.5 vs 66.9 years, p<0.001) and had a higher urinary protein/creatinine ratio (uPCR) (792 vs 452 mg/mmol, p<0.001), despite similar anti-proteinuria treatments and eGFR, and shorter time since diabetes diagnosis (8.7 vs 11.1 years, p=0.008). Polynesian participants had a more severe RPS classification (p<0.001). Median time from biopsy to kidney failure with replacement therapy was 1.59 years in the Polynesian population and 6.06 years in the mainland French population, accounting for death as a competing risk. Polynesian participants were at a higher risk of end stage kidney disease after adjustment for uPCR, eGFR, BMI and age at baseline (HR 2.45 [95% CI 1.23, 4.88]). In a clinical and histological reduced multivariable model, Polynesian origin, higher uPCR, lower eGFR, more severe RPS classification and presence of chronic vascular lesions were all independently associated with poorer kidney survival. The RPS classification was more strongly associated with kidney survival in participants from Polynesia (p value for interaction, 0.048), while a higher uPCR was more strongly associated with kidney survival in participants from mainland France (p value for interaction, <0.001). Older age and Polynesian origin were also independent risk factors for death.\n\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Starting at an earlier age, the evolutive course of DKD is also more severe in individuals from French Polynesia than from mainland Western Europe. Strong differences in clinical, histological and predictive outcomes of diabetic nephropathy were found in these different ethnic groups."

    "text": "INTRODUCTION: Protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs) remain a concerning burden in patients with kidney failure since their removal during hemodialysis is limited due to their tight binding to albumin. Here, we tested whether medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs), potent ligands of human serum albumin (HSA), could be used as binding competitors of PBUTs to increase their removal during a hemodialysis session.\n\nMETHODS: A simulated hemodialysis session was performed using bovine blood spiked with PBUTs in the presence of various MCFAs. Blood was sampled serially to measure the concentrations of PBUTs indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (p-CS).\n\nRESULTS: The binding of MCFAs to HSA was investigated in silico and using fluorescent probe displacement. The free fraction of IS and p-CS were measured after ultrafiltration of HSA solutions and uremic plasma in the presence of MCFAs (0.25-3 mmol/L). Among the four MCFAs tested, octanoate and decanoate were the most prone to interact with HSA Sudlow site II, one of two main binding sites on HSA. The in vitro incubation of HSA solutions and uremic plasma with MCFAs increased the free fraction of IS and p-CS. The per-dialytic infusion of octanoate significantly improved the fractional removal of p-CS from 38% to 88% and IS from 36% to 91%.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: MCFAs can effectively compete with PBUTs for binding to HSA. The per-dialytic administration of octanoate, which strikingly increased the removal of PBUTs, could constitute an efficient and cost-effective strategy to improve the possible clearance of these compounds and prevent their accumulation in patients with kidney failure."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis (LN), a severe complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), lacks effective therapies because of its complex pathogenesis. PANoptosis, an integrated cell death pathway that combines apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis, has been implicated in inflammatory diseases; however, its role in LN and potential as a therapeutic target remain unexplored. Total glucosides of paeony (TGP), a traditional Chinese medicine derived from Paeonia lactiflora Pall, has shown promise in LN treatment due to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying its renoprotective effects, particularly its potential regulation of PANoptosis, are poorly understood.\n\nPURPOSE: This study investigated the role of PANoptosis in LN pathogenesis and elucidated the therapeutic mechanisms of TGP, focusing on ZBP1-mediated podocytes PANoptosis.\n\nMETHODS: Four mRNA microarray datasets of renal tissues from patients with LN and LN mouse models were obtained from the GEO database, and were performed with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify PANoptosis-related pathways. Renal pathology was assessed using HE staining and proteinuria detection. Cell death was evaluated in vivo using TUNEL staining and in vitro through flow cytometry and LDH release assay. The protein levels of ZBP1 and PANoptosis markers were detected by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC).\n\nRESULTS: PANoptosis-related pathways were significantly enriched in LN kidneys. TGP treatment suppressed podocytes PANoptosis and alleviated renal injury in MRL/lpr mice. Mechanistically, TGP inhibited PANoptosis by regulating the STAT2-ZBP1 axis, with ZBP1 identified as a pivotal regulator. ZBP1 overexpression attenuated the therapeutic effects of TGP, confirming its central role in LN pathogenesis.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study reveals ZBP1-mediated podocytes PANoptosis as a key mechanism in LN and establishes TGP as a promising therapeutic agent targeting this pathway. These findings provide a novel, clinically translatable strategy for LN treatment."

We investigated the effects of butyrate supplementation on postural imbalance and intestinal leak in older adults.\n\nMETHODS: We recruited geriatric adult men into placebo (n = 66, age range=73.2 ± 3.4 years) and butyrate (n = 64, age range=70.4 ± 2.9 years) groups. The butyrate group received oral butyrate (300 mg/day) for 16 weeks. We measured postural balance in supine, tandem, and semi-tandem positions using a standardized tool. We also measured handgrip strength (HGS), gait speed, plasma zonulin and lipopolysaccharides-binding protein (LBP) levels as markers of intestinal leak in the study participants.\n\nRESULTS: At baseline, the balance scores, HGS, gait speed, plasma zonulin, and LBP levels were similar in the two groups. Butyrate supplementation was associated with a significant increase in HGS and gait speed and a reduction in plasma zonulin and LBP levels (all p < 0.05), which were not observed in the placebo group. Participants with higher postural balance exhibited higher HGS, gait speed, and lower plasma zonulin and LBP than participants with poor postural balance. We also observed dynamic associations of balance scores with HGS, gait speed, plasma zonulin, and LBP levels in the butyrate group. However, plasma CRP and 8-isoprostane levels were not affected by the butyrate supplement.\n\nCONCLUSION: Altogether, butyrate mitigates postural imbalance in older adults, which, at least partly, involves intestinal mucosal repair and improvement in skeletal muscle strength and gait speed."

As LNPs consist of different lipids, the lipid composition determines key properties of these particles. This study examines how lipid composition, especially helper and PEG-lipids, and RNA cargo (siRNA and mRNA) affect LNP performance in pulmonary delivery. By comparing two different helper and two different PEG-lipids, we assessed the impact on fusogenicity and endosomal escape, in vitro transfection efficiency, and subsequently protein corona formation. Their in vitro performance was assessed in the air-liquid interface (ALI) cell culture model, a sophisticated in vitro model of the lungs. Our results demonstrated that transfection efficiency and stability differ between the helper lipids DOPE and DSPC, depending on the RNA cargo. These differences can be attributed to the structural differences of the lipids and the different properties of the RNA molecules. Our investigations further demonstrated successful mucus penetration of all LNPs and 24-42 % gene silencing in vitro. We also explored mucus proteins/LNP interactions in human lung mucus, finding distinct protein corona formation for DSPC- and DOPE-containing LNPs. This comprehensive analysis highlights the critical role of helper lipids in combination with RNA cargo in determining LNP properties, efficiency, and in vitro performance, providing valuable insights for optimizing RNA delivery systems."

The regulation of LAT1 function and stability by cholesterol was previously described in ex vivo and in vitro experimental models. The complexity of the relationship between LAT1 and cholesterol has been further studied by investigating the impact of selected oxidized forms of cholesterol, focusing on the most abundant auto-oxidized form of cholesterol, namely 7-ketocholesterol, which increases with age and pathologies characterized by high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The partial substitution of cholesterol with 7-ketocholesterol in HEK293 cells transiently overexpressing the human LAT1 (HEK293-LAT1), decreases the Vmax of LAT1 mediated transport and the thermal stability of the protein. The impairing effect on transport was directly tested in LAT1 reconstituted proteoliposomes supplemented with 7-ketocholesterol. In this experimental model, it was found that the presence of 7-ketocholesterol altered the transport stimulation by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), as previously described. This was likely due to the higher rigidity of 7-ketocholesterol compared to cholesterol, which alters the membrane/protein interaction, weakening the ATP binding to LAT1. LAT1 transport function was also inhibited when proteoliposomes were supplemented with 7α-hydroxycholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol. These deleterious effects may be relevant in chronic pathological conditions characterized by altered cholesterol/oxysterol ratios, ranging from metabolic syndrome to kidney disease and neurological disorders."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, may lead to a cocktail of disease consequences, for instance, type II diabetes, liver fibrosis, and even hepatocarcinogenesis. The complex pathogenesis of NAFLD results in a shortage of an effective drug for its treatment. Currently, a healthy diet and regular exercise are considered one of the most effective and safe ways to mitigate NAFLD as well as other types of metabolic disorders. Kudzu-resistant starch (KRS) has developed as a potential dietary supplement attributed to its prebiotic properties, particularly its ability to regulate gut microbiota and intestinal barrier function. This study discusses the alleviative effects of KRS on high-fat diet and dextran sulfate sodium induced intestinal barrier dysfunction, inflammation, gut microbial dysbiosis, and liver steatosis.\n\nRESULTS: The results identified KRS has ameliorated intestinal barrier dysfunction by increasing the expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and mucin 2 (Muc2). Furthermore, it also down-regulated the gut-derived LPS/TLR4 signaling pathway, dramatically alleviating inflammatory responses, including serum, colon, and liver tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) levels. KRS also had attenuating effects on gut microbiota dysbiosis, restored the gut microbiota abundance and diversity, and increased the butyric acid-producing bacteria, such as Coprococcus, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus, and it exhibited positive effects in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). KRS attenuated fatty acid-induced lipid accumulation and regulates lipid metabolism via the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1-c (SREBP-1c), G-protein coupled receptors 43 (GPR43), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins-α (C/EBP-α).\n\nCONCLUSION: The findings reveal that kudzu resistant starch could be a potential supplement for metabolic syndromes, and the efficacy and effectiveness might facilitate the multi-targeting strategy required to mitigate NAFLD. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

In 1968, the CCK structure was identified by Viktor Mutt and Erik Jorpes from porcine gut extracts as a peptide of 33 amino acid residues. Based on that structure, physiological, immunochemical, molecular, and cell biological research has since expanded the insight into the biology of CCK remarkably. Thus, CCK was the first identified intestinal satiety signal to the brain. Moreover, the CCK gene is now known to be expressed in different molecular forms not only in the gut, but very much so in central and peripheral neurons, in addition to extra-intestinal endocrine cells, immune cells, cardiomyocytes, spermatogenic cells, and certain fat cells. Accordingly, CCK peptides function not only as hormones. They are also neurotransmitters, paracrine growth and satiation factors, anti-inflammatory cytokines, incretins, adipokins, myokines, potential fertility factors, and tumor markers. Consequently, CCK biology has now opened windows for insights into pathophysiology with diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities in metabolic disorders (obesity, eating disorders, and diabetes mellitus), gallbladder disease, neuropsychiatric diseases (cerebral tumors, memory, and anxiety disorders), cardiac diseases (prognosis in heart failure), neuroendocrine and pediatric tumors, as well as perhaps infertility."

    "text": "Bitter peptides are short amino acid chains that produce a bitter taste. These peptides are made primarily in food processing through the chemical reduction of peptides. The bitterness arises from the specific sequence of amino acids in peptides, which interact with the bitter taste receptors on the human tongue. These peptides influence nutrition and health, offering insights into protein digestion and bioactive advantages. Hence, correctly identifying bitter peptides is pivotal for revealing the biochemical properties of efficient medication. The computational approach is most suitable for identifying bitterness, where most studies obtained insufficient outcomes. Therefore, the current study developed an ensemble-based framework called \"BitterEN\", where we integrate the Gradient Boosting (GB) and Multi-layer Perception (MLP) methods. Our proposed method improved more than 3 % of accuracy compare to all of the state-of-the-arts methods, where the proposed approach achieved 0.995 accuracy in merged feature extractions with the Random Forest (RF) feature selection method. We used 50 iterations over the performance evaluation phases to enable a more exact generalization of model performance. In addition, we provided a convenient GitHub-based version of our bitter peptide identification. It highlights the practical applicability of these findings. We are optimistic that the proposed approach might benefit many fields, including healthcare development and nutritional science."

Several types of synthetic receptors have been engineered to deliver specific therapeutic proteins, including G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-based receptor systems, modular extracellular sensor architecture (MESA), synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptor, and synthetic intramembrane proteolysis receptors (SNIPRs). These receptors have demonstrated therapeutic potential in targeting tumors, inflammatory immune diseases, central nervous system disorders, arthropathies, and viral infections by delivering specific proteins to diseased tissues. However, several challenges persist, including safety concerns, suboptimal delivery efficiency, and receptor design and optimization complexity. This review summarizes the current types, characteristics, and biomedical applications of synthetic receptors for therapeutic protein delivery, while also addressing their limitations and potential future directions."

Despite the growing use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for 3MT quantification, poor comparability persists among laboratories. This study developed an isotope dilution LC-MS/MS-based candidate reference measurement procedure (cRMP) for plasma and urine 3MT measurement and evaluated LC-MS/MS results from over 100 laboratories in China.\n\nMETHODS: Plasma/urine samples were spiked with internal standard, followed by protein precipitation and solid-phase extraction. The final extract was analyzed using LC-MS/MS. The cRMP assigned values to four samples (202411-202414), which were sent on dry ice to over 100 laboratories in China for analysis using routine LC-MS/MS methods. Laboratory results were compared to cRMP-assigned target values.\n\nRESULTS: The method validation of cRMP showed good precision, with intra-run and total imprecision ranging from 0.97% to 3.85% and 0.99% to 4.03%, respectively. The relative recovery rate ranged from 99.51% to 104.61%. Significant biases were observed when comparing the measurement results of routine laboratories with the target values assigned by cRMP, and the results from different laboratories were not comparable.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our LC-MS/MS cRMP demonstrates high accuracy, precision, specificity, and sensitivity for 3MT measurements. By utilizing SI-traceable certified reference materials(3MT Cerilliant standard), it ensures robust traceability. This cRMP serves as a high-order standard for establishing traceability, calibrating routine methods, and developing reference materials, supporting the standardization of 3MT assays."

Traditional collagen boosters like retinoic acid (RA), vitamin C (VC), hyaluronic acid (HA), and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) have drawbacks, including poor absorption, instability, and irritation. Studies reveal that Silk Bioactive Peptide (27 P peptide) binds to epidermis and dermal fibroblasts, enhancing prolonged pro-collagen 1 (pro-C1) secretion in 3D and 2D models. De-novo collagen synthesis by 27 P peptide, likely regulated at the translational level, resulted in elevated collagen deposition and matrix remodeling up to 120 h. Combination of VC and 27 P peptide rescues VC-induced intracellular collagen depletion. Unlike TGFβ and RA, 27 P peptide maintains balance between fibroblast subpopulations, without inducing markers of fibrosis or inflammation. Together, 27 P peptide presents as a promising alternative to effectively promote collagen production, fibroblast homeostasis and skin health."

The changes of radiomics features from pre-treatment and post-treatment gastric computed tomography images were extracted to build delta radiomics score and predict TR, as well as another radiomics score from pre-treatment vertebral computed tomography images for the prediction of HT, and both combined models were established from clinicopathological characteristics and radiomics score. The predictive performance of the combined models were evaluated using receiver operating characteristics, calibration and decision curve analyses. Interpretability was assessed using the shapley additive explanations framework (SHAP).\n\nRESULTS: The area under curve (AUC) in the combined model for predicting TR were 0.893,0.846 and 0.913 for the training, internal validation and external validation cohorts, respectively. The AUC in the combined model for predicting HT were 0.871, 0.917 and 0.865 for the training, internal validation and external validation cohorts, respectively. SHAP summary plots show the importance of each feature on the prediction outcome, while waterfall and force plots depict individual features' contributions to a response variable.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The combined models based on radiomics features for predicting TR and HT after programmed cell death protein 1 blockade plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy in LAGC demonstrated good predictive performance."

While ferroptosis has emerged as a pivotal contributor to renal fibrogenesis, the regulatory mechanisms governing this process-particularly those involving iron metabolism-remain poorly characterized.\n\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism through which silybin modulates FTH1 to regulate iron homeostasis, thereby suppressing ferroptosis and attenuating fibrotic progression in renal pathology.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN: The therapeutic efficacy of ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) and silybin was systematically evaluated in complementary in vivo and in vitro renal fibrosis models. Mechanistic investigations employed FTH1 knockout and overexpression systems to validate its role as a therapeutic target.\n\nMETHODS: Fibrotic inhibition was assessed histologically and via quantification of fibrotic markers. Iron ion concentrations and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured using standardized commercial assay kits. The silybin-FTH1 interaction was investigated through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Silybin administration demonstrated potent ferroptosis inhibition, significantly ameliorating pathological alterations and fibrotic marker expression across experimental models. FTH1 ablation exacerbated ferroptotic cell death and fibrotic progression, whereas FTH1 overexpression conferred robust protection against renal fibrosis. Mechanistically, silybin directly bound FTH1 protein, stabilizing its expression to counteract iron overload-induced ferroptosis.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study unveils FTH1 stabilization as a mechanistically novel strategy to disrupt the vicious cycle of iron overload and ferroptosis in renal fibrosis, offering a superior alternative to conventional ferroptosis inhibitors targeting downstream effectors."

    "text": "A long, healthy and pain-free life is the goal of an aging society. However, people become increasingly less active in old age, which can lead to sarcopenia. To counteract this development, strength training and a sufficient protein supply are essential. To investigate the effects of a high-protein diet in combination with strength training on oxidative stress markers in older adults, 116 men and women underwent a 17-week single-blind randomized control trial with 3 groups (Control CON, Recommended Protein RP and High Protein HP) as part of the NutriAging Study. After finishing a 6-week dietary intervention, a strength training program was additionally implemented for RP and HP for the remaining study period. CON continued with their habitual protein intake throughout the study. Blood was drawn at three time points (baseline T1, week 8 T2, and after study completion T3) and analyzed for chemical blood parameters and the oxidative stress markers superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), ferric reducing ability potential (FRAP); γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine (GSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), unconjugated bilirubin (UCB), and malondialdehyde (MDA). The results showed a significant time effect of certain blood parameters and all measured oxidative stress markers independent of group allocation. This can be explained by seasonal changes over the study period. Urea and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were significantly increased in HP, which could be attributed to the high protein intake, however they remained in the normal range. UCB and FRAP were significantly lower in HP, which could be due to the metabolization of the additional protein. Women in particular showed more altered oxidative stress markers as well as reduced uric acid (UA) in the HP group, suggesting lower estrogen secretion during menopause, possibly due to decreased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NrF2) synthesis and subsequently impaired antioxidant defense. The strength training intervention alone showed no negative effects on blood or oxidative stress parameters. In summary, a high-protein diet along with strength training showed no major impact on oxidative stress in older adults."

RNA sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in hypertrophic and control cardiac tissues. CircRNA expression levels were verified by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. Isoproterenol (ISO) was used to induce hypertrophy of AC16 cells. The extent of cell hypertrophy was indicated by the cell size, protein/DNA ratio and levels of B‑type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and β‑myosin heavy chain (β‑MHC). The interactions between hsa_circ_0072107 and miR‑516b‑5p, as well as between miR‑516b‑5p and zinc ring finger protein 36 (ZFP36), were confirmed through dual luciferase assays, biotinylated probe pull‑down and anti‑AGO2 RNA immunoprecipitation assays. hsa_circ_0072107 was one of the most upregulated circRNAs in hypertrophic cardiac tissues. hsa_circ_0072107 overexpression and ISO treatment increased cell size, elevated the protein/DNA ratio and increased the levels of BNP and β‑MHC in AC16 cells, indicating that hsa_circ_0072107 aggravates AC16 hypertrophy. These changes induced by ISO treatment could be blocked by the knockdown of hsa_circ_0072107. The dual‑luciferase activity assay indicated that miR‑516b‑5p can bind to hsa_circ_0072107. miR‑516b‑5p binding site mutation blocked the effect of hsa_circ_0072107. ZFP36 is a target gene of miR‑516b‑5p, which suppresses AC16 hypertrophy. hsa_circ_0072107 overexpression alleviated the effect of miR‑516b‑5p overexpression on cell hypertrophy and ZFP36 expression. hsa_circ_0072107 is up‑regulated in hypertrophic cardiac tissues and potentially promotes AC16 hypertrophy and may play its role by acting as a competitive endogenous RNA of miR‑516b‑5p. Thus, hsa_circ_0072107 may be a novel target for the treatment of myocardial hypertrophy."

To this end, the structure of ETX and an experimentally approved ETX inhibitor were prepared and docked as a control interaction and used for the determination of the binding site. An approved library of small molecules was obtained from the DrugBank database and prepared for virtual screening via size filtering and the addition of conformations. The top five molecules with the highest binding energy were used to draw their 2D interaction plots against ETX. A 100 ns MD simulation was performed on the Antrafenine-ETX complex as the best result of the screening stage in comparison to the control complex. The obtained results showed that among the 3849 molecules (which were analyzed by virtual screening), Cefotiam, Antrafenine, Ferric Derisomaltose, Mupirocin, and Salmeterol had the highest binding energies (binding energies respectively calculated to be -5.6, -5.8, -4.9, -4.9, and -4.6 kcal/mol). The 2D interaction plots also showed that the screened molecules had stronger interacting bonds with the ETX protein. MD simulations showed that the Antrafenine-ETX complex has a similar RMSD plot to the control complex, while its RMSF, hydrogen bond, and GR plots show better results for the Antrafenine-ETX complex. In light of these results, Antrafenine could be the best choice for ETX inhibition regarding strength, while based on the route of administration and drug applications, Cefotiam could also be considered for ETX inhibition. It seems that despite the promising results of the performed in silico studies, further empirical pieces of evidence would strengthen these conclusions in future studies."

Chronic hyponatraemia is associated with an increased risk of falling, osteoporosis and fractures, attention deficits, and even mortality.

However, despite hyponatraemia being encountered in all medical specialties, its clinical burden is often overlooked, partly due to low awareness but also to low confidence in applying diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms.

We employed multiple statistical methods and bioinformatics tools to identify shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Subsequently, we conducted functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction analysis, and TF-gene interaction network analysis, as well as TF-miRNA coregulatory network analysis.

This study aims to, for the first time, comprehensively interpret the short and long-term effects of MRF by combining histology, high-throughput molecular analysis, and clinical evaluation.\n\nMETHODS: At 1, 3, and 6 months after MRF in different parameters, the skin samples were taken for HE staining, Masson staining, and Victoria blue staining to observe the overall histological changes. Real-time PCR and WB were used to evaluate the quantitative changes of collagen I and III, MMP-2 and TGF-β1 at the different time periods. After transcriptome sequencing, bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify important biological processes related to skin after MRF treatment. At the same time, patients who had undergone facial MRF treatment in our department between 2020 and 2023 were collected for clinical review within half a year after treatment. Patient satisfaction score and Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) were collected.\n\nRESULTS: The histological sections showed that collagen and elastic fibers regenerated and the density increased after MRF. The mRNA and protein levels of collagen in each treatment group also showed an upward trend after treatment, especially in Group A. However, there was no significant difference among the treatment groups and compared with the blank control group. Transcriptome analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in collagen regeneration-related pathways at 1 month after treatment, then gradually decreased at 6 months. The clinical data showed that after MRF treatment, patients mainly rated the effect of skin rejuvenation as \"3 - satisfied.\" The GAIS score showed that the long-term effect after MRF was better than the short-term effect (p = 0.040).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: MRF can stimulate collagen rearrangement and rejuvenation in facial rejuvenation. The long-term rejuvenation effect of MRF can last at least 6 months and is better than the short-term effect."

    "text": "OBJECTIVE: Acute Cerebral Infarction (ACI) is characterized by high disability and recurrence rates, posing a significant threat to public health. The Chuanhong Zhongfeng (CHZF) Capsule, developed by national medical master Jixue Ren, has been clinically proven to promote neurological function recovery, reduce disability rates, and improve long-term prognosis in patients with cerebral infarction. However, the specific targets and potential mechanisms of action remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate, for the first time, the potential targets of CHZF Capsule in treating ACI and improving long-term prognosis, thereby providing direction for future research on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) compounds in ACI prevention and treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06874140).\n\nMETHODS: The study focused on identifying unique differential proteins in ACI patients treated with CHZF Capsule. Twenty ACI patients were divided into a medication group (CHZ) and a control group (DZZ) based on CHZF Capsule administration. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed using 4D label-free proteome quantification technology to identify differential proteins between the groups. Functional enrichment analysis, including Gene Ontology (GO) classification and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, was conducted to determine enrichment trends related to differential proteins. Hierarchical clustering was employed to identify relevant pathways enriched in each group based on P-values from the enrichment analysis. The STRING (v.11.5) protein interactions network database was utilized to obtain differential protein interactions, corresponding target proteins, and major related pathways. Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was subsequently applied to validate the selected target proteins. Finally, chord diagrams and ROC curves were plotted for visualization and analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Mass spectrometry analysis identified 1400 proteins, of which 1360 were quantitatively comparable. Using a P-value < 0.05 and change thresholds of > 1.5 for significant up-regulation and < 1/1.5 for significant down-regulation, 63 differential proteins were identified (27 upregulated and 36 downregulated). Cluster analysis revealed that Q4 (>2.0) was most closely associated with the complement and coagulation cascade pathway (hsp04610). Six proteins involved in acute inflammatory responses and immune processes were validated through PRM experiments: Complement factor H-related protein (CFHR) 4, Mannose-binding lectin protein (MBL) 2, Orosomucoid (ORM) 1, ORM2, Vascular non-inflammatory factor (VNN) 1, and Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -A. Chord plots and ROC curve analysis suggested the following order of biomarker sensitivity: CFHR4 > MBL2 > VNN1 > ORM1 = ORM2 > HLA-A.\n\nCONCLUSION: The observed changes in these six proteins in ACI patients may serve as indicators of long-term prognosis. The complement and coagulation cascade pathway is closely associated with ACI development. These findings provide a basis for ACI recurrence prevention and contribute to the development of integrated Chinese and Western medicine approaches for ACI treatment."

While the protective effects of physical activity (PA) are well-documented, less is known about the interplay between PA, low-grade inflammation, and mental health. Biobehavioural mechanisms underpinning mental health may become more prominent when encountering novel stressors, which were particularly prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Leveraging data of a national sample of older adults from England, this study tested (1) if pre-pandemic PA and its changes during the pandemic were associated with mental health responses; (2) if older adults with low-grade inflammation experienced greater increases in depression and anxiety, compared to pre-pandemic levels; (3) if PA attenuated the inflammation-mental health associations.\n\nMETHODS: The study used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a cohort study following a national sample aged 50 + (N = 5829). Information on mental health and PA was collected before the pandemic (2016/17 and 2018/19) and during November and December 2020. Inflammation was ascertained using pre-pandemic C-reactive protein (CRP). Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic and health-related factors and pre-pandemic mental health.\n\nRESULTS: Increasing PA from before to during the pandemic was linked to reduced odds of depression (OR = 0.955, 95 % CI [0.937; 0.974]) and anxiety (OR = 0.954, 95 % CI [0.927; 0.982]). Higher pre-pandemic PA was associated with reduced odds of depression (OR = 0.964, 95 % CI [0.948; 0.981]) and anxiety (OR = 0.976, 95 % CI [0.953; 1.000]), whereas elevated CRP was associated with 1.343 times higher odds of depression (95 % CI [1.100; 1.641]). PA did not attenuate the inflammation-depression association.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that PA may contribute to psychological resilience against stressful life events among older adults but does not appear to mitigate the adverse effects of systemic inflammation on mental health. Further research is needed to explore the psychobiological pathways underlying this protective mechanism."

    "text": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe obesity and associated with increased oxidative stress. This phenomenon is partly attributed to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which promote inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, contributing to significant metabolic complications. Growth hormone (GH) treatment is widely used in children with PWS due to its well-documented benefits, including improvements in body composition, motor development, and cognitive function. In this study, we assessed the oxidative stress profile in children with PWS treated with GH. Since obesity and inflammation are well-established contributors to oxidative stress, values obtained from non-syndromic obese patients were included as a reference, allowing the findings to be contextualized within the framework of oxidative stress. The study included 12 GH-treated PWS children with a mean age of 15 years and 11 non-syndromic obese patients with a mean age of 14 years. Flow cytometry was employed as the primary method to analyse markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial function in both groups. Additionally, this technique enabled the identification of immune cell populations associated with chronic inflammation, acute inflammation, and immune response, providing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Despite PWS children having 4- to 6-fold lower glutathione (GSH) levels, PWS children demonstrated 2- to 3.5-fold higher mitochondrial activity, increasing their antioxidant capacity and reducing lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation by up to 2-fold compared to non-syndromic obese children. GH-treated PWS children also showed lower mitochondrial dysfunction under oxidative conditions, higher cell viability, and elevated inflammatory biomarkers, suggesting a link to senescence and premature ageing. GH-treated PWS children, despite being non-obese, exhibited higher systemic inflammation compared to the non-syndromic obese group, alongside significant differences in oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. These findings suggest that mitochondrial pathways may play a role in antioxidant responses in PWS, highlighting the complexity of oxidative stress and its potential contribution to premature ageing in this condition. Understanding these mechanisms and the role of GH treatment could inform the development of targeted therapies to better manage oxidative stress and inflammation, ultimately improving the quality of life for PWS children."

Studies have shown that the composition of gut microbiome is closely related to the geographical environment, ethnicity, and dietary structure of the host. Currently, most of the mainstream probiotics on the market are based on the gut microbiota characteristics of Western populations, which may not be completely suitable for the gut environment of Chinese people. Therefore, the isolation and screening of bifidobacteria with probiotic functions in the intestinal tract is critically important to meet the demands of the Chinese market. In the present study, 217 bifidobacterial strains were isolated and identified from 35 fecal samples collected from the city of Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China. Further investigations were conducted to determine the probiotic potential of these strains. Among the screened strains, Bifidobacterium longum ssp. longum IMAU12449 was identified as the most promising probiotic strain. The survival rate of strain IMAU12449 was highest in the simulated artificial gastrointestinal fluid. The survival rate of strain IMAU12449 in artificial gastric fluid for 3 h was 62.38%, and the survival rate was 40.30% in the artificial intestinal fluid for 8 h. Furthermore, the strain exhibited excellent cell autoaggregation (72.79%) and surface hydrophobicity (45.66%). Strain IMAU12449 also exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on common pathogens. Safety evaluation revealed that the strain possessed 2 potential antibiotic resistance genes and no virulence factors. This strain exhibited γ-hemolysis in vitro. The advantages of a stable viable count, moderate acidity, and absence of whey precipitation were observed in fermented cow and soy milk processed by strain IMAU12449 combined with commercial starters.

    "text": "Liposomes continue to play a key role in drug delivery and diagnostics, with applications in cancer therapy and vaccine formulations. Their unique characteristics enable the development of more effective delivery systems. However, the behavior of liposomes in vivo differs significantly from their in vitro performance, which can impact their clinical application. Upon systemic administration, liposomes must circulate in the body for extended periods to reach target tissues. A challenge arises when liposomes encounter biological fluids in vivo, where proteins and other biomolecules form a \"protein corona\" around the liposomes, which can alter their function. Despite the development of stealth liposomes, completely preventing protein corona formation remains a challenge. The presence of the protein corona can interfere with interactions between targeting ligands and tissues, potentially reducing the efficacy of targeted delivery systems. Recent studies, however, suggest that the protein corona may also be utilized to enhance liposome functionality and targeting. This review explores the formation of the protein corona on liposomes, the factors influencing the structure and composition of liposome-protein corona complexes, and strategies to control this process. It also examines in vivo studies on protein corona formation and its impact on liposome behavior, targeting capacity, and drug release profiles. Finally, we discuss the concept of personalized liposome-protein corona complexes for the detection of disease biomarkers in vivo."

While factors regulating expression of immune checkpoint proteins such as PD-L1 are well documented in adult cancers, their regulation is poorly understood in pediatric cancers.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed Wilms tumor specimens with reverse-phase protein arrays. We validated correlations using published sequencing data, flow cytometry, and immunoblots.\n\nRESULTS: Using unsupervised clustering of protein arrays, we found that immune markers like PD-L1 are upregulated in distinct subsets of Wilms tumor, the most common pediatric kidney cancer. Specifically, chemotherapy-exposed Wilms tumor specimens exhibited higher levels of PD-L1 expression, and common chemotherapeutics upregulated PD-L1 in vitro. Furthermore, mutations in CTNNB1 and DROSHA, the two most commonly mutated genes in Wilms tumor, correlated with higher PD-L1. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and knockdown of DROSHA or DICER1 both increase PD-L1 in vitro.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Together, our results identify clinical and biological properties regulating PD-L1 in Wilms tumor that may inform precision therapy approaches in pediatric immuno-oncology."

Therefore, the effects of ATP7B (ATPase copper-transporting beta) deficiency and/or a high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of steatohepatitis were investigated in mouse models and the relationship of hepatic steatosis with cardiometabolic factors was examined in patients with WD. A retrospective analysis of data was conducted on adults with WD. Of the 61 patients with WD, 11.5% had evidence of hepatic steatosis, significantly linked to cardiometabolic factors. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) was used to generate Atp7b gene knockout (KO) mice, followed by a comprehensive phenotypic analysis. A HFD was administered to induce steatohepatitis, allowing for analysis of lipid metabolism and hepatic injuries in KO mice subjected to overnutrition. Although ATP7B KO mice under normal diet exhibited significant copper metabolism disorders without overt hepatic or neurologic injury, steatohepatitis was successfully induced in both wild-type and KO mice after 24 weeks of HFD. Compared with a normal diet, a HFD resulted in markedly decreased hepatic copper levels with obvious liver injury in KO mice. Moreover, HFD-fed KO mice exhibited significantly higher severity of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis than wild-type control mice. Results suggest that hepatic steatosis in WD relates more to acquired metabolic dysfunction than excess copper accumulation, underscoring the influence of nutritional excess on WD phenotypes."

Although autophagy and lysosome biogenesis defects have been described in DMD muscles, the endosomal pathway has never been studied. The current study revealed an association of impaired lysosome formation with altered acidification and reduced degradative function of the endolysosomal pathway in muscle cells derived from patients with DMD. Early endosomes were increased in these cells as well as in muscle biopsies from patients with DMD and two animal models of DMD, mdx mice and golden retriever muscular dystrophy dogs. These abnormalities occurred due to the lack of dystrophin per se and could be correlated with disease progression and severity. An abnormal up-regulation of the Rab5 GTPase protein, one key actor of early endosomal biogenesis and fusion, was identified in the three DMD models, which may underlie the endosomal defects. Finally, Rab5 knockdown in human DMD muscle cells as well as dystrophin restoration in golden retriever muscular dystrophy dogs normalized Rab5 expression levels and rescued endosomal abnormalities. This study unveiled a defect in a pathway essential for muscle homeostasis and for the efficacy of DMD therapies."

The search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus. Gray literature was searched in ClinicalTrials.gov and Google Scholar.\n\nSTUDY SELECTION/RESULTS: Based on the eligibility criteria, 1133 publications were screened, and 465 duplicates were removed. Of the remaining 16 studies assessed for full-text review, eight investigating the oral microbiome of saliva, carious roots, or dental plaque in patients with root caries were included. These studies reported the intra-community species diversity (alpha-diversity, 4/8 studies), inter-community compositional diversity (beta-diversity, 4/8 studies), dominant microbial genera/species (8/8 studies), and functional pathways (1/8 studies) of the microbial community in root caries patients. Alpha-diversity showed no significant difference between root caries and sound root surfaces in three studies, but root caries exhibited a significantly lower alpha diversity in one study. Beta-diversity differed significantly between root caries and sound root surfaces in three studies, with one study reporting no difference. The dominant microbial species in root caries varied among the included studies. However, Lactobacillus spp., Prevotella denticola, Propionibacterium acidifaciens, Streptococcus mutans, and Veillonella parvula/dispar were frequently identified in the root caries-associated microbiota. Furthermore, root caries-associated bacteria altered the predicted functional pathways, promoting organic acid production and accelerating collagen degradation.\n\nCONCLUSION: Root caries microbiomes exhibit distinct compositional profiles, dysbiotic species predominance, and a shift in predicted functional pathways compared to healthy root surfaces.\n\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This review provides valuable insights into root caries' microbial landscape, potentially guiding future preventative and therapeutic strategies."

Zinc finger NFX1-type containing 1 (ZNFX1), an RNA helicase family member, remains relatively understudied in molecular biology and its role in cardiovascular diseases remains unclear. This study aims to explore the involvement of ZNFX1 in MI and uncover its mechanisms. This research found ZNFX1 was decreased in MI myocardium and hypoxia-treated cardiomyocyte. Overexpression of ZNFX1 significantly attenuated myocardial dysfunction, reduced infarct size, inhibited collagen deposition and alleviated cardiac hypertrophy which was ascribed to MI in mice, whereas knockdown of ZNFX1 produced the opposite effects. Mechanistically, RNA-seq identified apoptosis as a possible regulated pathway of ZNFX1, overexpression of ZNFX1 repressed the cardiomyocyte apoptosis that gives rise to MI while knockdown of ZNFX1 deteriorated it. Given the structural similarity between ZNFX1 and UPF1 that confers RNA decay functionality, an in-depth investigation is needed to understand the collective impact of ZNFX1-mediated RNA decay on the process of apoptosis. Here, we report that ZNFX1 plays a protective role in MI by degrading mRNA of apoptosis-related genes, which possess highly structured 3'UTRs. Collectively, this study provides a novel insight into the regulatory mechanisms of programmed cell death, potentially uncovering new targets for therapeutic intervention in diseases where apoptosis is a critical factor."

However, those medications can reduce systemic inflammation and possibly promote skin health. The rapid weight loss observed with GLP-1RA has been implicated in facial aging. However, recent evidence suggests further pathophysiological mechanisms for this side effect. The aim of this article is to review the literature and present available data on the possible mechanisms of GLP-1RA on skin aging. Indeed, GLP-1RA may affect other types of skin cells, which may accelerate the process of skin aging itself. More specifically, GLP-1RA can act on adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) and fibroblasts, that present GLP-1R on their surface. Stimulation of the receptor reduces the ability of ADSC to produce protective cytokines. The absence of those cytokines promotes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and causes oxidative damage on fibroblasts. GLP-1RA also reduce the glucose intake of the ADSC, leading to reduced production of ATP and apoptosis. Finally, the stimulation of GLP-1R on ADSCs reduces indirectly the production of estrogens from dermal white adipose tissues (DWAT), which reduces stimulation of fibroblasts to produce collagen. GLP-1RA can also affect the process of skin aging through interaction with advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and RAGE (receptors of AGEs) activation. In conclusion, many patients receiving GLP-1RA suffer from \"Ozempic face\" and facial aging. It seems that this complication is not exclusively related to decreased facial fat, but there are more aging mechanisms that have to be elucidated."

This study explores the relationship between TXNIP levels and obesity-associated IR in women with PCOS.\n\nMETHODS: A case-control study was conducted from January 2019 to December 2020, including 161 women with PCOS and 107 healthy controls. PCOS patients were categorized into insulin-resistant (IR) and non-IR subgroups, further divided by BMI into obese, overweight, and normal weight groups. The metabolic parameters such as cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, homocysteine, and serum TXNIP levels were measured. Logistic regression assessed the relationship between TXNIP expression and metabolic dysfunction.\n\nRESULTS: TXNIP levels were significantly higher in the PCOS group compared to controls (67% increase), with a further 56% increase in the IR subgroup. The TXNIP levels were elevated in the obese group compared to overweight and normal weight groups (P < 0.05). TXNIP expression was negatively correlated with obesity (R = - 0.116, P = 0.007) and HDL cholesterol (R = - 0.196, P = 0.001), but positively associated with triglycerides (R = 0.181, P = 0.003) and homocysteine (R = 0.130, P = 0.034). After adjusting for confounders, TXNIP remained significantly associated with IR (P < 0.05). TXNIP demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance in distinguishing IR from non-IR PCOS patients, with an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI 0.84-0.94; P < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: TXNIP is significantly correlated with IR in women with PCOS, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for metabolic abnormalities. Further research is needed to fully understand its role in obesity-induced IR in PCOS."

However, this has not been consistently demonstrated in adults, nor at all in children.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To test the associations between explicit and implicit food reward and preference at baseline and prospective changes in weight and body composition in adolescents with obesity.\n\nMETHODS: A meta-analysis of 6 clinical trials in adolescents with obesity was undertaken using frequentist and Bayesian linear mixed models. Participants from each study took part in similar 12-week multidisciplinary interventions. Liking and wanting for foods varying in fat content and sweet taste were assessed at enrolment, and both anthropometrics were tracked from enrolment to post-intervention.\n\nRESULTS: In a grand sample of N = 132 adolescents with obesity, liking and wanting for high-fat foods did not significantly predict changes in weight or fat mass. However, implicit wanting for sweet foods predicted changes in standardised body and lean mass, such that a greater wanting for sweet foods was associated with greater loss of body (p = 0.039, η\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Baseline implicit wanting for sweet (high carbohydrate, low protein), but not energy-dense, foods may be more strongly related to prospective changes in lean mass than fat mass during weight loss in adolescents with obesity. Further research is needed to clarify whether low protein intake can account for this effect."

The inhibitory effects of natural polyphenols and the control chlorhexidine (CHX) on matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 8 (MMP-2 and MMP-8) were assessed using fluorometric assay kits. Bacterial collagenase activity was measured by analyzing the loss of dry mass and released hydroxyproline. In situ zymography (ISZ) was conducted to determine matrix-bound protease activity. Furthermore, in silico molecular docking simulations were performed to investigate the interactions between natural polyphenols and proteases.\n\nRESULTS: SEM observation demonstrated the collagen-protective effects of four natural polyphenols against collagenase digestion. However, only PA showed a performance comparable to CHX group on both recombinant MMP-2 and MMP-8. Concerning bacterial collagenase, PA and EGCG exhibited superior inhibitory effects compared to QUE and RES (p < 0.05). The fluorescence intensity of ISZ indicated stronger suppression of endogenous protease activity in the PA and EGCG groups than in the QUE and RES groups. Molecular docking analysis consistently showed that PA and EGCG had higher binding affinities for both MMP2 and MMP8 than QUE and RES.\n\nCONCLUSION: Natural polyphenols can deactivate both soluble and matrix-bound proteases, the stronger inhibitory effect may be attributed to the formation of more hydrogen bonds.\n\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Natural polyphenolic protease inhibitors with more hydroxyphenyl radicals could potentially enhance anti-proteolytic performance and bonding durability."

Immunoassays, particularly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are commonly used for protein biomarker detection but often suffer from insufficient sensitivity at low concentrations. Enhancing the detection capacity of ELISA for early diagnosis is therefore essential.\n\nRESULTS: Herein, a simple and cost-effective strategy was developed to enhance ELISA performance by pre-enriching target proteins using molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). MIPs, synthesized with high absorption capacity and specificity, were prepared using TrF (Transferrin) as the template and polypeptide as crosslinker. Target protein was pre-enriched through large-volume adsorption followed by small-volume elution. This pre-enrichment process resulted in an 8.25-fold increase in protein concentration, significantly improving ELISA sensitivity and reducing the limit of detection (LOD) by nearly an order of magnitude. The enhanced detection performance was validated in terms of accuracy, precision, and linearity.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: This method, which combines MIP-based protein enrichment with ELISA detection, offers a promising and cost-effective solution for enhancing ELISA performance. It holds great potential as a widely applicable strategy for the sensitive detection of biomarkers in disease diagnostics."

This study investigated whether systemic inflammation, measured by C-reactive protein (CRP), is associated with adverse kidney outcomes in adults with ASCVD.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.\n\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 83,928 adults with ASCVD in Stockholm, Sweden, who underwent routine CRP testing between 2007 and 2021.\n\nEXPOSURE(S): CRP was defined as the geometric mean of serum CRP levels within a 3-month ascertainment window, excluding CRP values potentially associated with an acute inflammatory process.\n\nOUTCOME(S): Acute kidney injury (AKI; based on diagnosis code or Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] serum creatinine criteria) and a composite kidney outcome defined as a sustained>30% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate or kidney failure.\n\nANALYTICAL APPROACH: Cause-specific Cox proportional hazards regression.\n\nRESULTS: 54% of the cohort was male, with a mean age of 71 years, and 59% of participants had systemic inflammation (CRP≥2mg/L). During a median follow-up of 6.4 years (IQR, 3.1-9.8 years), 8,371 kidney events, 10,757 AKI events, and 24,954 deaths were recorded. Compared with CRP<1mg/L, higher CRP categories were associated with increased risks of both outcomes. Compared with a CRP of≤1mg/L, the adjusted HRs for the composite kidney outcome were 1.16 (95% CI, 1.09-1.23) for CRP>1-3mg/L, 1.24 (1.17-1.32) for CRP>3-10mg/L, and 1.35 (1.25-1.46) for CRP>10-20mg/L.

We conducted an observational study in more than 83,000 adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease undergoing routine care. The study showed that CRP levels were higher in participants with lower levels of kidney function and that CRP was associated with more rapid declines in kidney function over time as well as a greater risk of acute kidney injury."

Unfortunately, its overaccumulation in kidney proximal tubular cell (PTC) results in severe acute kidney injury (AKI). Bismuth drugs have long been used to treat gastrointestinal tract disorder and Helicobacter pylori infection. Interestingly, oral administration of bismuth drugs can also mitigate cisplatin-induced AKI, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we found even low concentrations of bismuth can specifically increase the survival rate of human PTC upon excessive cisplatin exposure. Using multiomics and protein-small molecule interaction techniques, we identified mitochondrial iron-binding protein ALKBH7 as a specific target of bismuth. By gene knockout and silencing, we demonstrated that ALKBH7 depletion indeed greatly increases cell survival rate upon excessive cisplatin exposure. Furthermore, we found bismuth treatment depletes ALKBH7 in mice kidney and prevents cisplatin-induced AKI. Overall, our evidence suggests ALKBH7 is a specific target of bismuth drugs, and ALKBH7 inhibitors are potential drug candidates for mitigation of cisplatin-induced AKI."

    "text": "The rising threat of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), necessitates the development of novel antiinfective strategies. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), a significant foodborne pathogen, secretes virulence factors that are crucial to its pathogenicity. Unlike conventional antibiotics, antivirulence strategies offer a promising approach by targeting these factors without inhibiting bacterial growth, thereby reducing selective pressure for resistance. Among these factors, von Willebrand factor-binding protein (vWbp) is a key contributor to S. aureus pathogenesis, mediating prothrombin activation and subsequent blood coagulation, which is vital for pathogen survival in the host. This study identified astragaloside IV (As-IV), a bioactive compound from traditional Chinese medicine, as a potent inhibitor of vWbp coagulase. As-IV effectively prolongs coagulation time and reduces S. aureus biotic matrix formation on surfaces relevant to food safety, such as catheters, in vitro. Mechanistic studies, including thermal shift assays (TSAs) and fluorescence quenching, revealed that As-IV directly binds to vWbp, attenuating its activity without altering protein expression levels. In vivo, As-IV exhibited protective effects in infection models, underscoring its potential as a virulence-targeted therapeutic. These findings significantly contribute to the advancement of antivirulence strategies and underscore the potential of As-IV in combating S. aureus infections. This paves the way for its broader application in enhancing public health measures and promoting innovative therapeutic approaches."

OXA-48 carbapenemase is one of the notorious enzymes that inactivates carbapenems through hydrolysis. The emergence of OXA-48 and OXA-48-like carbapenemases is a significant concern as they are responsible for many outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections in various countries, with limited treatment options available. Thus, targeting this enzyme and inhibiting its activity can be an attractive therapeutic strategy. In this study, a rational computer-aided approach was applied to design effective inhibitory peptides against OXA-48 carbapenemase. The primary library was constructed based on peptides derived from the Human Antimicrobial Peptide (HAMP) database. The binding of peptides to the enzyme was investigated through molecular docking studies using ClusPro. After each screening step, numerous targeted amino acid substitutions were performed to enhance the affinity and physicochemical properties of the selected peptides. The final selected peptides, in complex with the enzyme, were subjected to 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the GROMACS package, and MM/PBSA analysis was conducted to evaluate the binding free energy of the enzyme-peptide complexes. Finally, the inhibitory effects of the designed peptides were also computationally assessed on OXA-48-like carbapenemases. Homology modeling was used to generate 3D structures of the enzymes whose structures were not solved experimentally. Results indicated that the two final selected peptides effectively interacted with the important residues of OXA-48 carbapenemase and spatially blocked its active site. These peptides also demonstrated high binding affinity to the most common OXA-48-like carbapenemases in silico.

Despite the recognized role of PATJ in cell polarization, its specific functions in metabolic disease and ischemic stroke recovery remain largely unexplored. We explored the functions of PATJ in an in vitro model and in vivo in C. elegans and mice. Using a mouse model of stroke, we found post-ischemic stroke duration-dependent increase of PATJ abundance in endothelial cells. PATJ knock-out (KO) HEK293 cells generated by CRISPR-Cas9 suggest roles for PATJ in cell proliferation, migration, mitochondrial stress response, and interactions with the Yes-associated protein (YAP)-1 signaling pathway. Notably, PATJ deletion altered YAP1 nuclear translocation. PATJ KO cells demonstrated transcriptional reprogramming based on RNA sequencing analysis, and identified dysregulation in genes central to vascular development, stress response, and metabolism, including RUNX1, HEY1, NUPR1, and HK2. Furthermore, we found that mpz-1, the homolog of PATJ, was significantly upregulated under hypoxic conditions in C. elegans. Knockdown of mpz-1 resulted in abnormal neuronal morphology and increased mortality, both of which were exacerbated by hypoxia exposure, indicating a critical protective role of PATJ/MPZ-1 in maintaining neuronal integrity and survival, particularly during oxygen deprivation stress relevant to ischemic stroke. These insights offer a new understanding of PATJ's regulatory functions within cellular and vascular physiology and help lay the groundwork for therapeutic strategies targeting PATJ-mediated pathways for stroke rehabilitation and neurovascular repair."

    "text": "Identifying factors that contribute to the age-related onset of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is crucial for its prevention and treatment. The multifunctional endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein disulfide isomerase A1 (PDIA1) shows a protective increase in expression levels in human and mouse non-COPD smokers. However, this increase slows with aging and disease progression, while increase in glutathione S-transferase π1 (GSTP1) does not. PDI has redox sensitive cysteine residues that can become S-glutathionylated (PDI-SSG) which compromise both isomerase and chaperone activity. Oxidized PDIA1 levels progressively rise with age in the lungs of murine non-smokers, with an even greater increase in smokers. To investigate whether an increased oxidized-to-native PDIA1 ratio (PDI-SSG/PDI-SH) contributes to the depletion of alveolar epithelial type 2 progenitor cells in COPD, we used the type-2-like cell line MLE12. High doses of cigarette smoke (CS) induced elevated oxidized PDIA1 levels, while a redox-refractory PDIA1 variant maintained a lower PDI-SSG/PDI-SH. Upon CS exposure, PDIA1 was S-glutathionylated by GSTP1 and predominantly localized at the ER-mitochondria interface. This mitochondrial proximity was prevented by pharmacological or genetic GSTP1 inhibition. When localized at the ER-mitochondria interface, S-glutathionylated PDIA1 decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), facilitated mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, decreased mitochondrial respiration and triggered cytochrome c (Cyt c) release, followed by caspase-3 activation. Isolated mitochondrial studies confirmed that PDI-SSG trigger these apoptotic signals whereas native PDI does not. Our findings indicate that GSTP1-mediated S-glutathionylation of PDIA1 drives pro-apoptotic intraorganellar signaling by altering its ER distribution. Overexpression of a redox-refractory PDIA1 variant restored MMP and reduced Cyt c release, suggesting that a lower S-glutathionylated-to-native PDIA1 ratio is protective. These findings highlight a threshold-dependent regulation of PDIA1-SSG/PDIA1-SH redox signaling. We propose that the simultaneous inability to maintain high PDIA1 levels and the age-associated increase in its S-glutathionylated form in smokers accelerates AEC2 depletion and exhaustion, thereby contributing to emphysema progression."

Traditionally, pseudotyping has been achieved using adherent host cells transiently expressing foreign glycoproteins, followed by infection of the host cells with a glycoprotein G (VSV-G) presenting virus that is deficient in glycoprotein genes. This adherent production method is challenging to scale up, which limits many applications.

This eliminated the need for media exchange and enhanced process scalability. Key process parameters such as multiplicity of infection (MOI) and production duration were optimized to improve pseudoparticle productivity.

Trabeculectomy, the most common glaucoma surgery, could fail due to excessive scarring of the filtering bleb, driven by the hyperproliferation of human Tenon's fibroblasts (HTFs). Herein, the impact of aging on matrix stiffness in Tenon's capsule tissue, the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness in the phenotypic transformation of HTFs, and the regulatory function of integrin alphavbeta6 (αvβ6) were investigated. Matrix stiffness in Tenon's capsule tissue is notably lower in elder glaucoma patients in comparison with younger ones, with reduced levels of α-SMA, collagen I, and integrin αvβ6. GFS (Glaucoma Filtration Surgery) models were established in young and old SD rats, and it was observed that older rats exhibited lower ECM stiffness, reduced fibrosis, and decreased integrin αvβ6 expression. HTFs from elderly glaucoma patients showed reduced ECM stiffness, decreased viability, impaired migration, and diminished fibrotic responses. When HTFs from young glaucoma patients were cultured on substrates of varying stiffness, it was found that stiffer substrates increased cell viability, migration, collagen synthesis, and fibrosis marker expression. Additionally, knocking down integrin αvβ6 in HTFs cultured on stiffer substrates resulted in decreased cell viability, impaired migration, reduced collagen synthesis, and lower fibrosis marker expression. In vivo knockdown of integrin αvβ6 effectively reduced ECM stiffness and fibrosis, thereby attenuating bleb scarring after GFS in young rats. Collectively, the aging-associated changes in ECM stiffness and integrin αvβ6 expression contribute to reduced fibrosis, potentially enhancing the success of trabeculectomy in elder patients."

Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-based therapies, has become an important approach for CRC treatment. However, only specific patient subsets demonstrate significant clinical benefits. Although the TIDE algorithm can predict immunotherapy responses, the reliance on transcriptome sequencing data limits its clinical applicability. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and computational pathology provide new avenues for medical image analysis. In this study, we classified TCGA-CRC samples into immunotherapy responder and non-responder groups using the TIDE algorithm. Further, a pathomics model based on convolutional neural networks was constructed to directly predict immunotherapy responses from histopathological images. Single-cell analysis revealed that fibroblasts may induce immunotherapy resistance in CRC through collagen-CD44 and ITGA1 + ITGB1 signaling axes. The developed pathomics model demonstrated excellent classification performance in the test set, with an AUC of 0.88 at the patch level and 0.85 at the patient level. Moreover, key pathomics features were identified through SHAP analysis. This innovative predictive tool provides a novel method for clinical decision-making in CRC immunotherapy, with potential to optimize treatment strategies and advance precision medicine."

    "text": "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are one of the components of epigenetic mechanisms that regulates gene expression. Studying ncRNA-protein interactions (NPI) can help to explore a wide range of biological features and related diseases. Traditional NPI research methods often require expensive equipment, a lot of time and labor. With the abundant samples accumulated from traditional experiments, remarkable progress has been made in the study of NPI by computational methods. Heterogeneous graph neural network is a deep learning method that synthesizes heterogeneous types of data as well as network topology. In this study, we propose an NPI-HetGNN model for NPI prediction based on heterogeneous graph neural networks. Firstly, initial features are constructed by integrating the sequence properties of ncRNA and protein data as well as the topology of heterogeneous connections. Then, the multilevel homogeneous subgraph is obtained and its semantic information is aggregated by metapath walking. At the same time, the homogeneous node information is fused within the subgraph metapath. To enhance feature extraction ability of the network, an energy-constrained self-attention module is introduced. Due to the lack of wet lab validation conditions, this study adopts computational verification. The performance of the NPI-HetGNN model on four benchmark datasets is experimentally verified. Ablation experiments also confirmed the comprehensiveness and validity of our model design. The experimental results show that comparing with six state-of-the-art methods, our NPI-HetGNN achieves very satisfactory results on all four datasets."

    "text": "Human rhinovirus (RV) is one of the most frequent human pathogens. As causative agents of most common colds, RVs originate serious socioeconomic problems, and they are also associated to or exacerbate severe respiratory diseases. No anti-rhinoviral drugs or vaccines are available yet. In this study, amino acid residues that delimit a druggable pocket in the RV capsid were individually replaced by larger residues, which in most cases resulted in impaired virus infectivity. After serial infections of human host cells, the hampered mutant viruses invariably recovered full infectivity. Sequencing of the viral progeny revealed that, contrary to what has been observed when deleterious mutations were introduced in other virus capsid regions, those mutant RVs did not regain infectivity through the fixation of second-site mutations. Instead, infectivity was always recovered through reversion or pseudo-reversion events that replaced the deleterious bulky residue with a smaller residue, even though this strategy required, in some cases, the improbable fixation of two nucleotides in the corresponding codon. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations and determination of mechanical elasticity by atomic force microscopy revealed that the small-to-large, deleterious mutations reduced the capsid conformational flexibility; and the large-to-small, infectivity-restoring (pseudo)reversions led to recovery of the capsid flexibility. The stereochemistry of this druggable hydrophobic pocket in RV appears to be biologically constrained: The deleterious effect of reducing pocket volume and capsid flexibility is reverted during virus propagation only through same-site mutations that restore pocket volume and capsid flexibility. These constraints may help the further development of anti-RV drugs."

The species and diversity of blood and urine microbiota did not have difference between AML patients and healthy controls. Restitution of alpha and beta diversity of blood microbiota and urine microbiota to resemble that of healthy controls occurred after cessation of treatment. Temporal variation of urine microbiome was higher than blood after treatment which was closely related to pathogenic bacteria and beneficial bacteria measured by coefficient of variation (CV) of alpha diversity. The temporal variability of urine microbiota was significantly correlated with platelet and exposure of levofloxacin. The variation of microbiome of AML patients with infection was found that the relative abundance of Burkholderia significantly enriched in blood and urine which had high accuracy and sensitivity. The correlation between blood microbiota and serum amino acid metabolites was similar to that between gut microbiota and serum metabolites.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study represents the first comprehensive investigation to quantify the longitudinal variability of blood and urine microbiota in AML patients, revealing distinct patterns compared to gut microbiota and associations with adverse clinical outcomes. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging stabilizing taxa as a target for microbiome restoration."

Tectorigenin (TEC) is a flavonoid compound extracted from Bupleurum and saponins, which are traditional Chinese medicines with anti-inflammatory properties. Previous experiments have found that it can alleviate CPT-11-induced diarrhoea and synergistically inhibit tumor growth with CPT-11, but the specific mechanisms remain unknown.\n\nMETHODS: A CPT-11-induced diarrhoea mouse model was used to study the protective effect of TEC on CPT-11-induced diarrhoea in mouse by measuring levels of inflammatory cytokines and intestinal tight junction-related proteins in colon tissues. The chemopreventive effect of TEC was evaluated by measuring levels of inflammatory cytokines and intestinal tight junction-related proteins in Caco-2 cells exposed to CPT-11 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Finally, the synergistic effect of TEC combined with CPT-11 on tumor growth was investigated in a mouse model of colon tumors induced by subcutaneous implantation of CT26 colon cancer cells.\n\nRESULTS: TEC inhibited CPT-11-induced intestinal toxicity, as evidenced by reduced weight loss, decreased diarrhoea scores, and less intestinal shortening in mouse. Histological analysis demonstrated that TEC alleviated CPT-11-induced intestinal barrier damage. Additionally, TEC activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Nrf2/Keap1) signalling pathway, reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines both in vivo and in vitro, alleviated intestinal inflammation, and increased the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins, thereby enhancing intestinal barrier function. Furthermore, TEC exhibited a synergistic effect with CPT-11 in anti-tumor therapy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that TEC alleviates CPT-11-induced intestinal inflammation by activating the Nrf2/Keap1 signalling pathway and enhances the anti-tumor effect of CPT-11 in colon cancer."

    "text": "Long-term survival following a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is greatly diminished when transplantation and surgical resection are ruled out. Fortunately, the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized the treatment of advanced unresectable HCC (uHCC), prolonging median survival by over a year. T lymphocytes normally eliminate neoplastic cells, but some tumors suppress this response by binding to immune checkpoint receptors. Blocking this interaction via ICIs restores immune-mediated targeting of cancer cells. While ICI-based combination immunotherapy is currently recommended as the first-line systemic therapy for uHCC, the objective radiological response rate remains limited to 20-30%, as not all tumors exploit this mechanism. Consequently, strategies are being explored to modulate the immune microenvironment into a \"hot\" environment more responsive to ICIs by combining local therapies such as transarterial chemoembolization, ablation, and radiation therapy. Therapeutic options have also expanded beyond ICIs, emphasizing the importance of selecting the most appropriate treatment. Therefore, the development of biomarkers capable of predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy is a priority. Direct evaluation of immune cell infiltration through biopsy is currently the most effective method but involves issues such as invasiveness and susceptibility to sampling bias. In this review, we aim to highlight promising non-invasive biomarkers and scoring systems that have the potential to improve treatment outcomes, including blood-based biomarkers such as lymphocyte ratios, cytokines, C-reactive protein, and alpha-fetoprotein; imaging biomarkers such as MRI, ultrasound, and contrast-enhanced CT; and other clinical indicators such as sarcopenia, grip strength, and diversity of the gut microbiome."

Some of the lipid interacting segments in protein sequences are intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which may gain secondary structures upon binding. We collected experimentally annotated lipid-interacting IDRs, named membrane molecular recognition features (MemMoRFs). We used this dataset to develop and test an accurate and relatively fast sequence-based MemMoRF predictor, pLMMoRF, thereby supporting tedious and costly experimental identification of MemMoRFs. Our predictor utilizes a protein language model (pLM) which we processed to generate inputs to a deep convolutional neural network. We considered various pLMs (ESM-2, ProstT5, ProtT5 and Ankh) and applied feature selection to reduce their outputs, creating a more compact neural network model. pLMMoRF leverages the Ankh-based model, selected for its higher accuracy compared to our other models. Tests on low similarity test datasets demonstrate that pLMMoRF is more accurate than the sole current predictor of MemMoRFs, CoMemMoRFPred. Moreover, pLMMoRF has a relatively small computational footprint because of the compact network size and use of dedicated GPU nodes. This allowed us to make MemMoRF predictions for the human proteome. We analyzed these predictions and made them publicly available, facilitating an improved understanding of functions of membrane-coupled proteins. Our work underscores the importance of selecting key embedding features to enhance predictive performance and reduce computational footprint of sequence-based predictors of protein functions. The web server for the pLMMoRF predictor and the predictions for human proteins are freely available at https://plmmorf.hegelab.org."

Intrinsic capacity scores were computed based on five key domains (sensory, mobility, cognition, vitality, and mood). Pareto analyses were performed to determine the domains impaired in the majority of participants, and multivariable linear regression to explore factors associated with low intrinsic capacity.\n\nRESULTS: The median age in the 202 PWH were 50 years [interquartile range (IQR): 44-57 years] and median intrinsic capacity score was 5.60 (IQR: 4.80-5.80, max 6). Deficits in vitality were observed in 52.8% of participants, followed by cognition (18.8%) and mood (18.1%).

Recombinant TM (rTM) carrying the C252G mutation in both the extracellular domain (rTM-EC/C252G) and the membrane-penetrating type exhibited an attenuated inhibitory effect on thrombin generation compared with rTM-WT. Moreover, rTM-EC/C252G exhibited lower activation of thrombin catalytic protein C and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor than rTM-EC/WT, which may enhance coagulation and fibrinolysis. Protein conformation heatmap analysis revealed that the rTM-EC/C252G mutant induced TM structural changes with >25% relative uptake differences compared with rTM-EC/WT.\n\nCONCLUSION: We identified 2 novel TM variants (C252G and C280X) associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation-like thrombosis bleeding syndrome, providing the first genetic evidence of the critical role of Cys252-Cys265 in maintaining the structure and function of TM."

NDs are characterized by cognitive and motor decline, resulting from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Currently, there is no cure for NDs. Gene and RNA editing therapies offer new possibilities for addressing NDs. Gene editing involves modifying mutant genes associated with NDs, while RNA editing can directly modify RNA molecules to regulate the protein translation process, potentially influencing the expression of genes related to NDs. In this review, we examined the historical evolution, mechanisms of action, applications in NDs, advantages and disadvantages, as well as ethical and safety considerations of gene and RNA editing. While gene and RNA editing technologies hold promise for treating NDs, further research and development are needed to address safety, efficacy, and treatment timing issues, ultimately offering improved treatment options for ND patients.

Carotenoid supplementation led to significant effects in assessing oxidative stress induced by exercise (overall oxidative stress: SMD = -0.55, 95% CI [-1.04, -0.06]; malondialdehyde: MD = -0.05, 95% CI [-0.09,-0.02]; total antioxidant capacity: MD = 0.03, 95% CI [0.02, 0.03]; 8-isoprostane: MD = -35.70, 95% CI [-59.32, -12.09]; lipid peroxide: SMD = -1.07, 95% CI [-1.94, -0.20]; and nitric oxide: MD = -8.07, 95% CI [-12.54,-3.59]), inflammatory markers (inflammatory levels: SMD = 1.63, 95% CI [0.81, 2.46]; interleukin levels: SMD = 1.54, 95% CI [0.69, 2.40]; and C-reactive protein: MD = 4.56, 95% CI [0.97, 8.14]), antioxidant levels (SMD = 0.84, 95% CI [0.14, 1.53]), and metabolic parameters (energy expenditure: SMD = -0.52, 95% CI [-0.78, -0.26]; p < .05).\n\nCONCLUSION: Carotenoid supplementation appears to attenuate exercise-induced oxidative stress and the inflammatory response and improve antioxidant levels and metabolic capabilities. However, these results may be influenced by participant variability or methodological differences. Further research with larger sample sizes, longer supplementation periods, higher doses, and carotenoid bioavailability is needed to confirm these findings."

    "text": "AIMS: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a medically significant arbovirus responsible for Chikungunya fever (CHIKF), a debilitating disease marked by persistent joint and muscle pain. The most severe outcomes of CHIKF, including mortality, are frequently observed in individuals with comorbidities diabetes mellitus (DM). This study aimed to investigate how varying glucose concentrations influence CHIKV infection.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in normal glucose (NG - 5.5 mM glucose) or high glucose (HG - 25 mM glucose) to mimic normoglycemia and hyperglycemia conditions. Cells were infected with CHIKV and changes in host glucose metabolism were evaluated. Metabolic flux, viral replication, and cellular insulin sensitivity were assessed through biochemical, molecular analyses and metabolomics.\n\nKEY FINDINGS: CHIKV infection modulates host cell metabolism in a glucose-dependent manner. Under NG conditions, the virus regulates glucose metabolism to support replication and virion production. In contrast, HG environments enhance viral replication, exploiting the altered metabolic landscape. Notably, CHIKV restores insulin sensitivity in HG conditions, leading to increased glucose uptake. It also promotes anaplerotic reactions by diverting tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates toward amino acid synthesis and upregulates glycolytic flux into the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP).\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: These findings provide mechanistic insight into how hyperglycemia associated with DM can exacerbate CHIKV pathogenesis. The virus's ability to hijack and redirect host metabolic processes in high glucose environments may underline the worsened disease severity observed in diabetic patients. Understanding these interactions could inform targeted therapeutic strategies for managing CHIKF in individuals with metabolic comorbidities."

However, due to species-specific differences in metabolism, lifespan, and dietary composition, no single model could fully recapitulate the onset and progression of human MASH. Therefore, a detailed transcriptomic reference is urgently needed to better guide model selection and experimental design.\n\nMETHODS: We established three murine MASH models: HFD, MCD and CDA-HFD. Physiological and pathological features were systematically evaluated and compared across models. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing were performed, and the resulting data were integrated with transcriptomic profiles from CCl₄-induced models and human MASH datasets, with a focus on metabolism, inflammation, fibrosis, and cellular signaling pathways.\n\nKEY FINDINGS: The CDA-HFD and CCl₄ models closely resembled human MASH in inflammation and fibrosis but disrupted key metabolic pathways. Conversely, the HFD model mirrored metabolic abnormalities but lacked severe inflammation and fibrosis. Immunoinfiltration and single-cell analyses revealed that macrophages dominate the inflammatory process, with activation of PPAR signaling, extracellular matrix remodeling, and phagocytosis.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: To balance metabolic and pathological fidelity without relying on genetic or toxin means, a combination of the CDA-HFD model with either HFD or WD is recommended as a robust and practical strategy for MASH research."

    "text": "OBJECTIVE: Frailty, nutrition, and comorbid conditions are all challenges that contribute to significant morbidity in patients undergoing lower extremity arterial bypass (LEAB). Evidence supports that enhanced recovery pathways (erps) can improve perioperative outcomes. However, few studies have demonstrated successful implementation of an ERP for LEAB. The goal of this study was to demonstrate the successful implementation of an ERP in a complex patient population undergoing LEAB, including elective, urgent, or emergent procedures with the goal of decreasing length of stay (LOS) and morbidity for patients undergoing these procedures at our institution.\n\nMETHODS: Multistakeholder meetings with representatives from all vascular surgery practice sites in the Northwestern Medicine system were conducted to review current evidence-based practices and finalize an ERP for patients undergoing LEAB. Pathway elements included standardized patient education, minimal perioperative fasting with preoperative carbohydrate loading, opioid-sparing analgesia, and early postoperative diet and mobilization. The ERP was initiated in February 2022 as a pilot at a single institution. At 20 months, patient data and process and outcome measures were abstracted from the medical record and validated by four independent reviewers for univariate analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Over the 20-month study period, 112 patients underwent LEAB. Process measures were tracked to determine compliance with the ERP. Patients had to receive >70% of the pathway elements to be considered part of the ERP (n = 60). If patients missed >30% of the elements, they were analyzed as traditional pathway (n = 52). There were no significant differences in patient demographics, body mass index, or hemoglobin a1c. ERP patients were more likely to be elective (76.7% vs 48.1%; P = .0004) and for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (76.7% vs 48.1%; P = .001) and less likely to be urgent or emergent. No significant difference was observed in frequency of infrageniculate bypass target or operative duration. Compliance with 10 perioperative process measures ranged from 28% to 98% in the ERP group. Compliance was most successful with preoperative education (81.6%), chlorhexidine wash (80.0%), postoperative mobilization (90.0%), early solid diet (98.3%), and postoperative opioid sparing strategies (98.3%). Challenges included preoperative acetaminophen (28.3%), carbohydrate load (33.8%), and postoperative protein supplementation (28.3%). Notably, ERP patients demonstrated significantly reduced total LOS (7.8 days vs 13.6 days; P = .014), postoperative LOS (6.0 days vs 11.0 days; P = .0058), and unplanned reoperations (10.0% vs 28.9%; P = .015) when compared with traditional pathway patients. ERP patients trended toward fewer unplanned readmissions (13.3% vs 26.9%; P = .095).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that an ERP for LEAB is feasible in both elective and nonelective settings, although compliance with the ERP individual elements was more challenging for patients undergoing procedures for emergent or urgent indications. Patients undergoing ERP had improved compliance with process measures, reduced LOS, and fewer unplanned reoperations. Our results highlight the benefits of ERP for LEAB and the complex vascular surgery population and some of the potential barriers worth considering in this patient population."

Canakinumab (Ilaris) is an anti-human IL-1β monoclonal antibody that neutralizes IL-1β.\n\nMETHODS: We completed an open-label, single dose pilot study of canakinumab 2 mg/kg subcutaneous injection in steroid naïve boys with DMD older than 2 years of age to determine safety and potential serum response biomarkers of efficacy at 4-weeks post treatment. Proteome profiling was performed using high throughput multiplexing aptamer SomaScan assay based technology targeting 1,500 unique serum proteins.\n\nRESULTS: Three subjects completed the study with no adverse events reported and no significant changes in safety labs. Proteomic analysis within 4 weeks of treatment identified significantly decreased inflammation associated factors including plasma serine protease inhibitor, interleukin-6 receptor alpha, Lymphocyte antigen 86, Immunoglobulin D and myostatin. Significantly increased proteins included muscle-associated proteins aldolase A and lactate dehydrogenase B.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Canakinumab 2 mg/kg dose is safe for children with DMD and demonstrated potential response biomarkers of efficacy in treating related muscle disease. Canakinumab did not affect the circulating levels of IL-1β but did decrease some key proinflammatory markers and myostatin. Increased muscle specific proteins could be associated with increased physical activities or damage seen in young patients with DMD.

    "text": "Human health is influenced by the gut microbiota, particularly in aspects of host immune homeostasis and intestinal immune response. Tryptophan (Trp) not only acts as a nutrient enhancer but also plays a critical role in the balance between host immune tolerance and gut microbiota maintenance. Both endogenous and bacterial metabolites of Trp, exert significant effects on gut microbial composition, microbial metabolism, the host immunity and the host-microbiome interface. Trp metabolites regulate host immunity by activating aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), thereby contributing to immune homeostasis. Among Trp metabolites, AhR ligands include endogenous metabolites (such as kynurenine), and bacterial metabolites (such as indole and its derivatives). Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between Trp metabolism and 14 key microbiota, encompassing fungi (e.g., Candida albicans, Aspergillus), bacteria (e.g., Ruminococcus gnavus, Bacteroides, Prevotella copri, Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, lactobacilli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Helicobacter. Pylori), and viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus). This review clarifies how the gut microbiota regulates Trp metabolism and uncovers the underlying mechanisms of these interactions. And increased mechanistic insight into how the microbiota modulate the host immune system through Trp metabolism may allow for the identification of innovative therapies that are specifically designed to target Trp absorption, Trp metabolites, the gut microbiota, or interactions between Trp and gut microbiota to treat both intestinal and extra-intestinal inflammation as well as microbial infections."

    "text": "Autosomal Recessive Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is an early-onset neurological disorder caused by mutations in the SACS gene, resulting in the loss of sacsin function. Sacsin is a multidomain protein that plays key roles in chaperone regulation, protein quality control, and neurofilament dynamics. Sacsin deficiency leads to disruption of intermediate filament and mitochondrial networks. S100B, a multifunctional brain-enriched protein, exhibits protective neuroprotective functions that include chaperone activity and interactions with filament proteins and mitochondria. In this study, we used an established astroglial C6 cell model of ARSACS to investigate the potential compensatory effects of S100B on sacsin loss with respect to neurofilament integrity and mitochondrial morphological and functional hallmarks. Our results demonstrate that sacsin deletion induces S100B upregulation at both mRNA and protein levels, with the S100B protein colocalizing with perinuclear nestin aggregates and filamentous mitochondria networks. Genetic silencing and pharmacological inhibition of S100B exacerbate filament protein aggregation and mitochondrial defects, while supplementation with exogenous recombinant S100B improves ARSACS hallmarks, including decreased nestin aggregates. These findings provide evidence for functional compensation of sacsin loss by S100B in glial cells, and suggests a potential role for glial cells in ARSACS."

We aimed to evaluate these treatments for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia, for whom data on these antivirals are scarce.\n\nMETHODS: The RECOVERY trial is a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial testing treatments for COVID-19. In this study we report the molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparisons from the RECOVERY trial. In each comparison, participants aged 18 years and older were randomly allocated (1:1) to the relevant antiviral (5 days of molnupiravir 800 mg twice daily or 300 mg nirmatrelvir and 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) in addition to usual care, or to usual care alone. The molnupiravir comparison was conducted at 75 hospitals in the UK, two in Nepal, and two in Indonesia; the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison was conducted at 32 hospitals in the UK. Participants could take part in both comparisons. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were time to discharge alive from hospital and progression to invasive ventilation or death. Analysis was by intention to treat. Both comparisons were stopped because of low recruitment. This study is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381936.\n\nFINDINGS: From Jan 24, 2022, to May 24, 2023, 923 participants were recruited to the molnupiravir comparison (445 allocated to molnupiravir and 478 to usual care), and from March 31, 2022, to May 24, 2023, 137 participants were recruited to the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison (68 allocated to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 69 to usual care). More than three-quarters of participants were vaccinated and had antispike antibodies at randomisation, and more than two-thirds were receiving other SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. In the molnupiravir comparison, 74 (17%) participants allocated to molnupiravir and 79 (17%) allocated to usual care died within 28 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0·93 [95% CI 0·68-1·28], p=0·66). In the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, 13 (19%) participants allocated to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 13 (19%) allocated to usual care died within 28 days (HR 1·02 [0·47-2·23], p=0·96). In neither comparison was there evidence of any difference in the duration of hospitalisation or the proportion of participants progressing to invasive ventilation or death.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Adding molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir to usual care was not associated with improvements in clinical outcomes. However, low recruitment meant a clinically meaningful benefit of treatment could not be ruled out, particularly for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir.\n\nFUNDING: UK Research and Innovation (UK Medical Research Council), the National Institute for Health and Care Research, and the Wellcome Trust."

Research outside of sport suggests that the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, immune, anabolic, and cardiovascular systems, in particular, may be affected. However, few studies have explored the relationship between burnout and biomarkers of these systems in athletes. Consequently, the aim of the present multidisciplinary study was to explore the relationship between athlete burnout and acute and chronic biomarkers using a longitudinal N-of-1 design. Following a pre-registered protocol with open data, code, and materials, in two athletes, we examined burnout and acute salivary biomarkers (cortisol, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate [DHEA-S], secretory Immunoglobulin A [sIgA], and C-reactive protein) in 12 samples over six months. In another two athletes, we examined burnout and chronic biomarkers from hair and blood (hair cortisol, glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c], triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and DNA methylation in the BDNF, SLC6A4, and NR3C1 genes) in six samples over 12 months. Dynamic regression modelling showed that burnout symptoms predicted decreased testosterone and developed simultaneously with decreases in DHEA-S and sIgA. Visual analyses suggested that burnout symptoms also developed in conjunction with increases in HbA1c and SLC6A4 methylation and preceded increases in hair cortisol and BDNF methylation. Our findings provide a preliminary \"physiological fingerprint\" that could help explain athlete burnout development and consequences which can be used to guide future theory and research in this area."

    "text": "Celiac disease (CeD) is a chronic small intestinal autoimmune disease initiated by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Till date, the only effective treatment for CeD is the gluten-free diet (GFD). However, not all patients achieve full histological recovery despite GFD. Thus, it is crucial to assess the treatment response and improvement in the villous architecture following GFD. Therefore, present study investigated the potential of NMR-based metabolomics for identifying non-invasive biomarkers for assessing treatment response. Comprehensive metabolic profiling of 120 biological samples comprising of small intestinal mucosal biopsies, blood plasmas and urines collected at two time points (before and after 6-8 months of GFD) from CeD patients (n = 20) was carried out using proton NMR spectroscopy. The levels of arginine glutamate, and glutamine were significantly reduced in both intestinal mucosa and blood plasma of CeD patients after GFD compared to their baseline values. These amino acids play an important role in intestinal energy metabolism, and alleviating inflammation, thereby contributing to healing mechanisms of small intestinal mucosa, following GFD. A logistic regression statistical model based on the combination of the above three blood plasma metabolites demonstrated AUC of 0.980, Youden index 0.900 with a sensitivity and a specificity of 90 % and 100 % for monitoring treatment response in CeD patients after GFD. The study revealed a panel of non-invasive plasma biomarkers (arginine, glutamate and glutamine) which may serve as surrogates of mucosal healing and treatment response in CeD patients, however, the findings need to be validated in a large cohort of patients."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: A method for predicting ulcerative colitis (UC) onset has not been established. Serum autoantibodies have been suggested as potential predictive biomarkers for UC onset. We aimed to validate the risks associated with serological and environmental factors and construct a model for predicting UC development.\n\nMETHODS: Using the population-based cohort studies (n > 83,000), we identified 42 individuals who were diagnosed with UC later in life and compared them with matched healthy controls. We analyzed serum anti-integrin αvβ6 antibody (anti-αvβ6) and anti-endothelial protein C receptor antibody (anti-EPCR) titers, and lifestyle and dietary habits to explore UC onset predictors. The predictive performance of the models was evaluated based on these predictors.\n\nRESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of anti-EPCR for predicting UC onset were 51.4% and 97.8%, respectively, comparable to those of anti-αvβ6 (52.5% and 97.6%, respectively). The proportion of individuals with insomnia was significantly higher in the preclinical UC group (adjusted odds ratio = 2.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-4.04, p = 0.019). The predictive performance of anti-EPCR alone was high with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 (95%CI 0.83-0.96), and that of anti-EPCR combined with anti-αvβ6 was even better with an AUC of 0.92 (95%CI 0.87-0.97); the lifestyle model had lower predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.65, 95%CI 0.55-0.74).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Anti-EPCR and anti-αvβ6 each strongly predict UC onset. The combined anti-EPCR and anti-αvβ6 model had stronger predictive performance than the single models."

    "text": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is the most prevalent inherited kidney disease and leads to bilateral kidney enlargement and progressive loss of renal function, often over decades. Comorbidities include hypertension, flank pain, and bacterial infections. The condition often necessitates prolonged multidrug therapy. Given the kidneys' critical role in drug excretion, the progressive functional impairment in the disease can lead to complications such as drug overdosing and unexpected levels of drug-drug interactions. Studies of drug-metabolizing enzyme and transporter expression in this patient group remain scarce. We conducted comprehensive global liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proteomic analyses of microsomal and cytosolic fractions from early-stage (chronic kidney disease stage: 13, n = 16) and end-stage autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients (chronic kidney disease stage: 5, n = 14), comparing them with age-matched healthy controls (n = 11). In the early-stage ADPKD samples, most drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters did not differ significantly from the healthy controls. Exceptions were EPHX2 and SULT1C2 in the cytosolic fraction, which showed a more than 2-fold decrease in abundance (P < 0.05). In contrast, the end-stage ADPKD kidney samples showed a decrease in the abundance of most measured proteins. Several drug-metabolizing enzymes, including CYP4F2, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7, exhibited statistically significant reductions (P < 0.05). Among the drug transporters, OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2 were below the limit of quantification in most ES-ADPKD samples. MDR1 was the only efflux drug transporter consistently measured, with an average abundance of 1.24 pmol/mg microsomal protein across all samples."
